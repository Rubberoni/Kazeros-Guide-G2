You also have to <code>guard</code> only one time, unless the person Kazeros was targeting moved too far away from him just before the <code>guard</code>.

Jarvan</p> <p>Kazeros dashes to the middle of the arena. After that he jumps on 1 player, creates walls around him and spawns 6 blue lines which stun people and explode later. He then dashes 4 times, each time changing the target. After the 4th dash he will then change target one more time and send a shockwave that destroys part of the wall. He then does an AOE around him that stuns players followed by raid wide explosion coming from him that kills aynone that did not hide behind the wall.</p> <p>2. Stonehenge</p> <p>\ud83d\uddd2\ufe0fExplanation </p> <p>Kazeros dashes to the middle of the arena. After that he sends 6 blue cones which immobilize players for the rest of the mech if hit while also creating 6 rocks around him. After that 4 cones come out of each rock which also imprison people followed by donuts around the players with either in or out safe, lines around the map and finally 4 more blue cones coming from the boss. After that you have to hide behind any rock.</p> <p>If somebody gets hit by any of the blue patterns he will be immobilized for the whole mech and thrown at the end of it towards the closest rock dealing 2 instances of damage to him - the moment he hits the rock as well as an explosion coming from the rock which destroys it. That also reduces amount of the safespots you can hide from the final explosion.</p> <p>\u2705Useful information</p> <p>On the Jarvan you need to be quick with getting out after he destroys the wall. You dont have that much time so be ready to spacebar out.</p> <p>Make sure to spread around on the Stonehenge to not overlap with other people and their donuts.</p>"},{"location":"G2-1/Phase_1/02._Special_Patterns/#50","title":"50%","text":"<p>\ud83d\uddd2\ufe0fExplanation </p> <p>At 50% Kazeros has only 1 available pattern.

It goes by 'Slow -&gt; Slow -&gt; Fast'.</p> <p>Anyone can do that, but 1 person will be forced to do it. That person will get the whole map covered in a red fog after a moment except for the safe spot in front of the Kazeros.

If you get hit by his red cones you will only take some damage, but if you get hit by the Kazeros's dash he will stun you and instakill you without a support DR.</p> <p>\u2705Useful information</p> <p>Its a long DPS window so the person <code>guarding</code> should focus on getting them right.</p>"},{"location":"G2-1/Phase_1/02._Special_Patterns/#75","title":"75%","text":"<p>\ud83d\uddd2\ufe0fExplanation </p> <p>Kazeros doesnt exacly have a trigger that happens at 75%. What happens when he reaches 75% is that he will do one of his 'unique patterns', usually after a few normal ones. He has 4 of those and they all are quite deadly. Its useful to learn how to play them, because even if you skip all special patterns, these 4 will be added to his 'pattern pool' on the last phase of gate 2-1.</p> <p>1. Co-Op</p> <p>Kazeros targets 1 person. He then crouches and does a 360 spin, followed by a jump and drop towards that person with a small explosion around him. After that he does a long range 360 <code>guard</code> around and finishes it with a <code>co-op counter</code>. If you fail the <code>co-op counter</code> then he will do a one more 360 spin with an inside safe and grab the person in front of him and slam with him.</p> <p>2. X</p> <p>Kazeros slides around 2 times with a 2nd one being towards one person. After that he slams the ground and creates an X shape explosion from his sides. Then he follows-up with an uppercut in front of him and a slam. After that he requires a <code>co-op counter</code> (<code>counter</code> in hard), which if failed he dashes forward and slams the ground, which creates an expanding explosions, which inflict the debuff making you explode around you after 9 seconds.</p> <p> you can see X hitbox.</p> <p></p> <p>3. Rain</p> <p>Kazeros's hands start to glow red and he lifts them up. After a moment he spawns 3 waves of puddles around him raining from the sky. They slowly expand outside with every wave. At the end he does a slam which stuns every player in a radius. If somebody gets stunned Kazeros will dash behind him and do a series of punches dealing heavy damage. If multiple people gets stunned he will choose one person between them. After that, if the person is still alive, he will then do a <code>co-op counter</code>, which if not done will just kill the player. If you succeed if then he will target you and you have to bait his hit from others.</p> <p>4. Double guard</p> <p>Kazeros does double guard - first with his right hand and then his left hand.</p> <p>If everyone misses it then he does a 360 spin.</p> <p>\u2705Useful information</p> <p>These patterns are slightly changed in hard mode. Rain shows stun indicator, X is only a normal counter, co-op not sure about it, because i havent experienced that one.</p> <p>While the co-op and X are pretty straightfoward in terms of dealing with them, on rain the safest solution would be to dash towards Kazeros after the 2nd wave and use splendid sacred bomb. You can spacebar the stun/GT it (this one i leave to you to test out, im just an artist player).</p>"},{"location":"G2-1/Phase_1/02._Special_Patterns/#100","title":"100%","text":"<p>\ud83d\uddd2\ufe0fExplanation </p> <p>Personally i would advise skipping it if you can, but if you really want to see why everyone in TFM was insantly restarting the gate if they did not manage to skip, here you go.</p> <p>Full meter pattern is, would say, the most unforgiving, requiring the most coordination pattern out of the whole raid. Its a combination of 3 overlapping attacks that immobilize you for the remainder of the duration and also 1 attack that instakills you (which pretty much always happens when you get immobilized). Each player gets orb that follows him around which instakills him. Multiples lines spawn around the map that stuns the players + AOE explosions spawn on the outside parts of the map also stunning the players + Kazeros slams a ground that sends a shockwave after a brief moment, that requires you to stop moving and look away otherwise you gets stunned.</p> <p>Below you can see how the mech looks like.</p> <p>Impossible Mech</p> <p>\u2705Useful information</p> <p>On hard mode there are only 2 orbs chasing the same people around and you only have to look away from the Kazeros. You also get a relic book from the achievement if you survive this mech with all 8 people alive. Overall would say that this mech is fairly simple compared to TFM.

Black clouds comes out just before the first set of puddles, second set of puddles and third set of puddles. After the 5th set of puddles the whole outside around Kazeros is fully covered in a black fog preventing you from going out.</p> <p>\u2705Useful information</p> <p>Overall there isnt one solution to this mech. What is mostly agreed upon is that you split into 2 parties to minimize the risk of getting hit and then bait the puddles to the sides.   After the puddles around the players explode you use splendid sacred bomb, to prevent getting stunned by the cloud, and dash towards the Kazeros.   Then you simply alternate between Sacred splendid bomb usage with DR from the supports to greed with damage. Try to find solution that works the best for your team.</p>"},{"location":"G2-1/Phase_1/03._Mechs/#prison","title":"Prison","text":"<p>\ud83d\uddd2\ufe0fExplanation </p> <p>The whole mech consists of 4 parts and it activates instantly after the 'Fog' (900x). The main objective is to destroy parts of the walls on the opposite side of each other. Its extremely important that you precisely aim the boss to avoid wiping on this pattern.</p> <p>1. First wall break.</p> <p>Kazeros will surround the players with a wall and aim towards one of them. After a few seconds he will send a shockwave and destroy part of the wall at which he was aimed at. At this point he can do all of his normal patterns.</p> <p>After 2 patterns he will initiate 2nd wall break. This one has 2 variations.</p> <p>2.1 Second wall break - real.</p> <p>Kazeros will jump up and disappear. After a moment he will drop down in the middle dealing damage around him while also targeting one random player with a red cone. After the landing he will push any players caught in the cone and spawn blue lines around him. After that he will target one player and send a shockwave towards him which destroy parts of the wall. Players should aim him towards the opposite side of the already destroyed wall and dodge the shockwave.</p> <p>2.2 Second wall break - fake.</p> <p>Kazeros will jump up and disappear. After a moment he will drop down in the middle dealing damage around him while targeting one random player with a red cone. After the landing he will push any players caught in the cone and spawn blue lines around him. After that he will target one player, but instead of sending a shockwave he will fake it and slam the whole arena, except for the spots where the walls were destroyed, imprisoning any players hit by it. Then he is gonna follow-up with another slam, but this time being only around him while also spawning puddles bellow every player which also imprison them if they get hit by them.</p> <p>3. Third wall break.</p> <p>This one will be either fake or real, based on which one he did first. He will do the other one. This one happens after 3 normal patterns instead.</p> <p>4. Flames.</p> <p>Instantly after the previous wall break (either fake or real) he will target one more random player with a cone and send a shockwave towards him. During this lots of red lines indicators will also spawn from the side going through middle of the arena. These are the flames that spawn on the sides where you destroyed the walls. If anyone touches them they will inflict the debuff that makes the player explode after 9 seconds.</p> <p>If you misplace any of the shockwaves, flames might hit the remaining walls which will result in a raid wipe. Thats why you want to be precise with destroying them.</p> <p>After that Kazeros will reposition towards middle again and start releasing a red fog around him which deals DOT for the remainder of the mech. At the same time rest of the walls will get destroyed and 3 waves of red flames, which work exactly as the ones that come from the sides, will start moving from all directions towards the Kazeros. Then he will do a large AOE explosion with a blue lines (both covering almost the whole map) which to avoid you have to move to the edge of the arena. Then its followed by another explosions, this time covering outside part of the map with safe spot being around the Kazeros.</p> <p>\u2705Useful information</p> <p>Shockwave is an instakill so make sure to avoid it.</p> <p>To differentiate between real and fake wall break you have 2 different indicators: Hand glow during targeting a player(fake - white; real - black), purple swirl (if there is a swirl around the Kazeros the moment he targets a player that means its a real one, if there is not then its a fake). Make sure that you are always on the side that you want to destroy in case if its a real break - you wont have much time to reach it if you are on the other side.</p> <p>When all of the walls are destroyed, and the red flames are coming from all directions, make sure to not tank too many of those. They deal a lot of damage and you want to coordinate with your support how to deal with the debuff that they inflict (you can GT to prevent getting it/cleanse it - make sure to manage your resources/time your greed)</p> <p>Beware of the DOT that Kazeros deals as well. You take damage from it if you are extremely close to Kazeros. It can eat through awakening's support in a moment so make sure to always reposition yourself/control your skills that move you forward. Otherwise you wont have any shields left to tank incoming flames.</p>"},{"location":"G2-1/Phase_1/03._Mechs/#blackhole","title":"Blackhole","text":"<p>\ud83d\uddd2\ufe0fExplanation </p> <p>This mech happens shortly after the 'Prison' mech.</p> <p>Kazeros spawns a blackhole in the middle of the arena that pulls players in making movement difficult. At the start of the mech one person will receive the 'eye' target and then it will swap to another one. First person with the eye is the direction he will look towards to at the start of this mech while the 2nd player will be the one who he dashes to.</p> <p>After creating a blackhole and switching target to a 2nd player he will dash towards him and spawn 5 consecutive lines aiming at him that go through the Kazeros, followed by one more recast of all lines, this time at the same time. Then he dashes one more time to the same player and performs a 360 grab. After that he rotates towards him and begins a stager check which spawns lots of explosions around the map (mostly middle) with an additional line going through the Kazeros and then some more lines around him. If you get hit by any of the lines/explosions you will be immobilized, sent flying and slowly get pulled towards the blackhole. If you fail the stagger its a raid wipe. When you success the stagger he will spawn 4 red cones that come out of the blackhole and reach the edges of the arena (which are an instakill in TFM).</p> <p>If you get grabbed he will throw you behind him dealing damage to you and players around.</p> <p>After the successful stagger Kazeros will dash to the middle and begin a 'Triple guard' pattern that happens at 50% of the meter (Check special patterns 50%). Then he will slam the ground and create 2 set of blue lines after each other and begin another stagger check. If you fail it then he will create one more set of blue lines and repeat the stagger check. If you fail for the 3rd time he will do a raid wipe. After that he will create an AOE explosion around him which will be larger if you fail the stagger check.</p> <p>Failed stagger:</p> <p>Successful stagger:</p> <p>After this mech, if you did not push him low enough, he will be doing normal patterns till you reduce his HP.</p> <p>\u2705Useful information</p> <p>You want to always bait Kazeros towards the opposite side of where he is looking at. Reason for that is this will guarantee you a safe spot on the edge of the arena after you stagger him. This also allows you to fully greed if you bait him on the 2nd dash right on the edge. You just place him outside, dodge the grab, stagger him and safely DPS without worrying about dodging the red cones.

Then Kazeros targets one person and 2 red cones spawns on both sides of him making him omnidirectional. Its a DPS check which requires you to deal enough inside these cones.</p> <p>Players should stack either on 3 or 9 (based on where you finish after the boulders) and a leader wants to go 6 and use sidereal. Reason for that is you want sidereal to hit from the cone side to make a DPS check easier (or in case of the hard mode instantly break it). If its still alive (or the sidereal missed), players who are not being targeted by the Kazeros should move inside the cones and finish the DPS check.</p> <p>If you succeed the DPS check then Kazeros will stop following that player and lock in place. Everyone should get behind him (not sides, there is still a hitbox) to avoid the rock that will fly towards Kazeros from his front. Then he targets one player again with the same rock, which this time is just some damage which supports should DR/shield.</p> <p>If you fail the DPS check it just kills the person who is being targeted (with everyone in front) with everything else being the same.</p> <p>Right after this mech he will dash middle and then towards top.

Same thing applies when he targets another player - this time to not troll positionals.</p> <p>This mech can be survived if failed with Crisis evasion - which is i like using Hyper Awakening from supports on that one. It persists long enough to save people from getting hit from the boulders and also to save them from the failed DPS check.</p> <p>If you go top after this mech then you can reach his back even tho he is dashing towards the edge.

If you can learn how he moves you can preemptively position yourself in front of him just before <code>counter</code> happens.</p> <p>2. Elgic Up-Down</p> <p>This pattern has 2 variations, but the main idea stays the same. Kazeros will do a <code>co-op counter</code> and make 3 people fly around with them either staying on the same level, going up or going down. They all move together and will end up on the same altitude. After they stop moving Kazeros will either glow dark or white. Then you either want to <code>Counter</code> him (which makes him swap his colour to the other one) or not. There are 2 solutions to this one - i will explain both of them and you can choose whichever one you prefer.</p> <p>2.1 Elgic Down version</p> <p>Solution 1: People end up on lower altitude -&gt; you need white Kazeros (he only attacks higher altitude) -&gt; check which color is Kazeros | If white - good, hide behind | If dark - bad, <code>co-op counter</code> him so he swaps colour and then hide behind. In example below you want to <code>co-op counter</code> him if he is dark, because people are close to the ground.</p> <p>Solution 2: Instead of looking at players you look at the Kazeros. He will dash 3 times while also changing his color (his 'afterimage') between them while people fly around. In example below he was 'Dark -&gt; Dark -&gt; Dark'. His last colour change (so only the 3rd dash) will determine which one you <code>co-op counter</code> - you want to <code>co-op counter</code> the same colour as his last dash. </p> <p>2.2 Elgic Up version</p> <p>Same principle.</p> <p>Solution 1: People are in the sky which means you want <code>co-op counter</code> him if he is white.</p> <p>Solution 2: His last dash was white (start of the video) which means you want to <code>co-op counter</code> him if he is white.</p> <p>\u2705Useful information</p> <p>For some more examples check Memorizer's video. He explains this mech with Solution 2 (and i think most if not all players will find it easier after getting used to the colours).</p> <p>People who will be sent flying are the same ones who <code>co-op counter</code>. That means you can control who do you send - you also have a lot of time to <code>co-op counter</code> (~2 seconds), but dont greed it - its better to do the mech than cause a raid wipe.</p>"},{"location":"G2-2/02._Mechs/#500x","title":"500x","text":"<p>\ud83d\uddd2\ufe0fExplanation </p> <p>Just a simple DPS check.

If no one gets hit he wont do a beam.</p> <p>\u2705Useful information</p> <p>If you go out too early you will get inflicted with slow and HP blindness. Fog also deals DOT as long as you are standing in it.</p> <p>You can also timestop this pattern and it wont count as getting hit.</p>"},{"location":"G2-3/02._Mechs/","title":"Mechs","text":"<p>This sections explains all the mechs that happen in g2-3.</p> <p>This gate also has a meter pattern which is the same as in g2-2. That means, just like in thaemine, it will transfer over any left over meter from the previous gate. It counts during cutscene as well so might want to use that to your advantage.</p>"},{"location":"G2-3/02._Mechs/#spotlight","title":"Spotlight","text":"<p>\ud83d\uddd2\ufe0fExplanation </p> <p>This mech happens around every 2 minutes.</p> <p>Kazeros will cover whole map in black fog. 7 people will be targeted by his clones while 1 person will be targeted by Kazeros himself. That person will be in spotlight (bright light pillar above him).</p> <p>Clones will perform small dash into cleave towards the players while Kazeros will either do a <code>guard</code> or a <code>counter</code> pattern that must be taken care of by the player who's targeted by him. This whole gimmick will repeat 4 times and will kill any person who fails it.</p> <p>\u2705Useful information</p> <p>During this mech everyone spreads around to avoid overlapping clones. Person being targeted by the Kazeros will have to check which motion Kazeros does to differentiate between a <code>guard</code> and a <code>counter</code>.</p> <p>1. Guard</p> <p>2. Counter</p> <p>You can look at the way Kazeros is holding his sword.</p> <p><p><code>guard</code></p></p> <p></p> <p><p><code>counter</code></p></p> <p></p> <p>Another way to identify which one is it is to sidestep when he appears. <code>Guard</code> version will follow your movement while the <code>counter</code> will lock on to your starting position.</p> <p>Its important to know that Kazeros <code>counter</code> pattern will knock you down in TFM which means you have to sidestep it first.</p> <p>To easly dodge the clones just wait for them to appear and then move into one direction. They lock on to your starting position.</p> <p>One more important thing: full meter mech, sacrifice and DPS check can delay spotlight. Whenever full meter happens the next spotlight is delayed by 30 seconds. Same goes with DPS check - spotlight can't start when its active. You can manipulate those two to delay next spotlight, because the timer starts when you enter the fight and whenever spotlight ends. As an example: You enter arena at 4:00, spotlight happens at 2:00. If DPS check activates before that time then spotlight will activate after DPS check ~2:30 - assuming DPS check takes 30-40 seconds and it adds a minute to the timer.</p> <p>Best way to manipulate it is to end g2-2 with a full meter mech so that it wont happen more than 1 time in g2-3. You enter into g2-3, delay spotlight with DPS check. Then you enter spotlight. Then you get full meter delaying next spotlight and also you get sacrifice before spotlight happens delaying it one more time. This way you will see spotlight and full meter only 1 time.</p> <p>Just be careful of going into g2-3 mid full meter - you will get it again instantly. Would advise to wait 1-2 patterns after it ends (or partially watch a cutscene ~15 seconds).</p>"},{"location":"G2-3/02._Mechs/#dps-check-75","title":"DPS Check  (75%)","text":"<p>\ud83d\uddd2\ufe0fExplanation </p> <p>This is just a DPS check which requires you to deal enough damage to get rid of additional bar bellow his hp. This mech activates at 75% of his hp and will give you additional time if you manage to clear it. Use Armen and recast as well.</p>"},{"location":"G2-3/02._Mechs/#sacrifice40","title":"Sacrifice(40%)","text":"<p>\ud83d\uddd2\ufe0fExplanation </p> <p>Kazeros will spawn an orb far away in front of him. One person has to enter it to activate a stagger mech. After that he will slowly walk towards him while exploding around. You have to stagger him before he reaches that person.</p> <p>\u2705Useful information</p> <p>Order of the patterns in this one:</p> <p>Explosion -&gt; explosion -&gt; <code>guard</code> -&gt; explosion -&gt; <code>co-op counter</code> -&gt; explosion -&gt; explosion.</p> <p>All of the explosions can be random, as in you are not guaranteed to get the exactly same shape of explosion every time.</p> <p>Third explosion that happens after the <code>guard</code> is not consistent. In clip above it was front/back without an indicator, but on the other one it was a normal yellow side explosion. To safely avoid it always position yourself on sides of the Kazeros after the <code>guard</code>.</p>"},{"location":"G2-3/02._Mechs/#fake-death-25-10","title":"Fake death (25%-&gt;10%)","text":"<p>\ud83d\uddd2\ufe0fExplanation </p> <p>The final mech and a finish line. During it all you want to do is use everything you have and hit the boss as hard as you can. Its a fake dps check that will kill everyone at the end and revive them. Everything will come off cd after you get revived.</p> <p>\u2705Useful information</p> <p>His HP always gets recuded during it from 25% to 10% which means any damage that you deal to him during it doesnt matter. All you want is to blast everything right after Vairgrys revives you.</p> <p>The moment he ascends is the timing for a hidden sidereal. If you dont want to use it hovewer i will also explain how the last last mech works (or if you lack damage to kill him during it).</p>"},{"location":"G2-3/02._Mechs/#rotating-pizza-0-x-25","title":"Rotating pizza (0% &lt; x &lt; 25%)","text":"<p>\ud83d\uddd2\ufe0fExplanation </p> <p>This one seems simple on paper, but execution gets a little bit tricky.</p> <p>At the start Kazeros will split arena into 2 diferent colours. The colour you get hit by is the one which will be your safe spot for the whole mech.</p> <p>After that he will start spawning cones of 2 different colours and you have to avoid the opposite one. After 2 explosions he will change position of arena splits. He will repeat this sequence 2 times and then he will start rotating as well.</p> <p>Now here comes the tricky part. At the start of this mech he split arena into 2 colours. It did 2 things:</p> <ul> <li>Marked you with the colours you need to stick with</li> <li>Showed you on which part of the arena you have to stay</li> </ul> <p>last mech - clip because the whole mech is too long and quality will be too bad to see what's happening.</p> <p>You can notice in the clip, that the halfed arenas did not dissapear. They are always there, but hidden bellow the pizza cones. That means you not only have to stick with the cone that has your starting colour. You also have to make sure that you stay on your half of the arena. Now where is the tricky part?</p> <p>During the rotation.</p> <p>Your safe half will be rotating around the Kazeros while he also spawns cones around. That means you have to rotate with it constantly and also lookout for the safe cones. Not only that - during this whole mech you have to attack him. It wont end otherwise.</p> <p>Some infographic:</p> <p></p> <p>If you started on blue, your safe spots will be on the left side on blue parts. If you started on yellow, your safe spots will be on the right side on yellow parts.</p> <p>If you get hit then you receive a debuff that makes you die after 10 seconds. If that happens just try to deal as much damage as possible before you die. You cant survive it even with Crisis.</p>"}]}
