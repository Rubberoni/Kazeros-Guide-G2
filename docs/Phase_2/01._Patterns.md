# <ins>Normal Patterns</ins>

<p align=justify>This phase starts right after getting past Prokel. Kazeros starts using some new patterns, some enhanced patterns from phase 1, as well as enhanced Prokel patterns.</p>

Patterns that previously were not that dangerous become deadly or straight up instakills. 

<p align=justify>There is also no <code style="color : Purple">gauge</code> bar during this phase so you don't have to worry about <code style="color : Purple">special patterns</code>, but there is a personal meter that you fill up by getting hit.</p>

<p align=center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rubberoni/Gifs/main/G1/Images/Meter_P2.png"></p>

There is only 1 way to reduce it: you have to properly execute any  Guard pattern.

If you reach 50% you spawn poop under you.

If you reach 100% you get mind controlled

## <ins>Repeat of the previous patterns</ins>
These are the patterns that Kazeros can still do from his Phase 1:

* [Cleave into slash wave](../Phase_1/01._Patterns.md/#cleave-into-slash-wave)
* [Clones](../Phase_1/01._Patterns.md/#clones)
* [Aggro guard](../Phase_1/01._Patterns.md/#aggro-guard)
* [Skewer (3rd pattern from Prokel)](../Phase_1/03._Mechs.md/#other-patterns)

<p align=justify>His stacks from post 900x patterns also stay and he can do the 2 exclusive ones in this phase if he reaches 4 stacks. They are extremely deadly in this arena because of lack of space due to shrinked/shrinking arena throughout the fight.</p>

## <ins>Clash</ins>

<p align=justify>This pattern happens only one time and it should appear right after Kazeros reaches <660x bars.</p>

<p align=justify>He holds his spear in front and then dissapears. Then he will reappear in one of the 4 corners while also spawning 3 shadow clones in the others. You will have to stand in front of the real one to clash with him.</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>You can diferentiate between real and clones by front/back indicators. Only the real Kazeros will have them.</i></p>

<i><p align=center>Fake</i></p>

<p align=center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rubberoni/Gifs/main/G1/Images/FakeClash.png"></p>

<i><p align=center>Real</i></p>

<p align=center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rubberoni/Gifs/main/G1/Images/RealClash.png"></p>

<i><p align=center>You can also find him by putting any dots on him, just like in Act 2 G2 brel with 4 clones spawning on the cardinals.</i></p>

<i><p align=center>Spots for clashes are 4 corners in the middle of a map indicated by symbols below.</i></p>

<p align=center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rubberoni/Gifs/main/G1/Images/ClashCorners.png"></p>

<i><p align=center>Timing for clash is:  
Tap - - Tap - - Tap Tap Tap - Tap  
Long pauses last around 1.3 seconds, short ones 0.65 and the last one 0.9</i></p>

<i><p align=center>After clash is done he will spawn 5 sets of chains that spawns on top of players and block part of the arena with walls which will instakill you if you are standing there (ex. Echidna fail clash).</i></p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>The same thing happens after successfully finishing 500x mech.</i></p>

<i><p align=center>There is also a possibility for him to do a singular chain drop whenever he is too close to the edge of the arena and he can't properly use his upcoming pattern and teleport to the middle.</i></p>

## <ins>Beyblade</ins>

<p align=justify>A vortex of fire appears above Kazeros head. After a moment he throws his spear in the middle of the arena and creates 2 donuts filled with fire. He also recalls his spear during that making it spin around him, pushing away players and dealing damage to them. The moment his spear fully returns to him he will start charging a beam towards one of the players just like in Prokel.</p>

    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Gifs/raw/refs/heads/main/G1/Phase_2/Beyblade_VID.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>While the spin doesn't deal that much damage, it can knock you out into the fire so beware of that.  
Beam itself also counts as multiple ticks of high damage and can push you into the fire as well.  
Overall its a dangerous pattern if you have an <code style="color : Red">aggro</code> so make sure to not kill yourself or your teammates with it.</i></p>

## <ins>Lauriel</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros dashes towards one person then rotates and does a frontal cleave. After that he will either send 2 waves of frontal slashes or do a back cleave. If his sword blinks after the cleave he will do another one behind him. If it does not, then he will send waves.</p>

<i><p align=center>No blink</i></p>

## <ins>Grab v2</ins>

Kazeros sends waves of flames in the shape of a tic tac toe board and tries to grab one person. Same grab as in phase 1.

    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Gifs/raw/refs/heads/main/G1/Phase_2/Grab_P2_VID.mp4">
</video>

## <ins>Stagger</ins>

<p align=justify>Elgic text spawns on the screen and the whole arena except for the zone around Kazeros becomes engulfed in flames. He will then constantly soak flames from the outside towards him which inflicts small amounts of damage and will start a stagger check.</p>

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Gifs/raw/refs/heads/main/G1/Phase_2/Stagger_VID.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>During this mech you also get 10 stacks of debuff. It reduces your stagger and the way to get rid of it is to tank the flames that Kazeros is sucking in. Supports just need to shield during the stagger so everyone can tank the flames to get rid of them quickly. You don't need to hold skills for a long time cuz the debuff gets cleansed in 2 seconds at most.</i></p>

<i><p align=center>The stagger is also lenient so as long as you have 8 people alive you don't have to worry about anything. Even with 4-5 people you can do it, but you will get a <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> pattern during the stagger if you take too long.</i></p>

## <ins>Gravity</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros spawns pillars of light that will periodically spawn on top of all players. After 5 times he will do <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> that will make you float if you fail and spawn a puddle beneath you. Everything deals a large amount of damage in this pattern so you want to avoid overlapping.</p>

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Gifs/raw/refs/heads/main/G1/Phase_2/Gravity_VID.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>There are multiple small things in this one. First of all you can't look at the Kazeros during this pattern because he is ticking you for a moderate amount of damage while increasing your gauge at the same time (just like in Echidna's forgotten mech that everyone is skipping now with snakes moving towards her). It's important to only look at him with <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> animation.</i></p>

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Gifs/raw/refs/heads/main/G1/Phase_2/Gravity_Medusa_VIDp.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>2nd is timing. <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> flash is a bit misleading because it can be a bit delayed or faster than it shows. Using it after 5 explosions is also not the best idea. The best way to do that is to look out for ‘Blink’ that happens above his head. It comes from the orb that he spawn. The moment it blinks for the first time (which indicates it disappeared) is the timing for <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code>.</i></p>

    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Gifs/raw/refs/heads/main/G1/Phase_2/Gravity_Timing_VID.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>Pattern, if executed correctly, also removes a portion of your meter as seen above.</i></p>

## <ins>Pizza</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros throws his spear which spins in the middle and spawns a pizza of flames which rotates counterclockwise. One person will also be targeted by a large cone which will explode after a few seconds for large amounts of damage. This cone spawns 2 times on the same player and there is small delay between them.</p>

<p align=justify>After that Kazeros will blind 2 players (if 8 are alive, 1 if 7, 0 if <=6) and attach to them a puddle that slows everyone inside it and explodes after a bit, while also requiring 2 singular <code style="color : Blue">counters</code> in a row (a few seconds between each one of them). They need to be done quickly otherwise it will count as a failed mech and Kazeros will do heavy damage around him while also spawning lingering puddles beneath every player.</p>

<p aling=center>After the <code style="color : Blue">counter</code> he will do an explosion covering the whole arena except for the zone around him.</p>

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Gifs/raw/refs/heads/main/G1/Phase_2/Pizza_1_VID.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>Flames themselves don't deal that much damage, but the cone’s damage is ridiculous and will also push you out.</i></p>

<i><p align=center>People with puddles need to stay out so that they don't slow down people <code style="color : Blue">countering</code> the boss.</i></p>

</video>

## <ins>Wall</ins>

This pattern is one of the most dangerous ones in this phase.

<p align=justify>Kazeros slashes in front of him and spawns a wall that shoots out a beam towards the side he was facing. It covers that whole side and makes you take tick damage if you stand there. This damage increases every 3 ticks making it impossible to tank even for supports without DR.</p>

<p align=justify>While the pattern itself sounds dangerous enough he will combo into different attacks making it extremely deadly if you misposition the wall placement, by completely blocking off the arena.</p>

There are 2 variations to this one.

<p align=justify>1. Poop wall - he spawns an orb which follows the closest player while targeting 1 random player. He then does a small combo which consists of whirlwind + dashes. He creates a wall on his 3rd slash towards the <code style="color : Red">aggroed</code> player.</p>

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Gifs/raw/refs/heads/main/G1/Phase_2/Poop_Wall_VID.mp4">
</video>

<p align=justify>2. Wall combo - he does a small dash and then creates a wall towards the <code style="color : Red">aggroed</code> player. After that he disappears for a moment and then reappears creating falling rocks above every player. Then he does a <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> pattern which happens 3 times and finishes with a single thrust.</p>

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Gifs/raw/refs/heads/main/G1/Phase_2/Wall_Combo_VID.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>Orb will lock onto the player’s position after a few seconds so you can move out of the way. It will explode creating a puddle which stays there for a while.  
It's important to make Kazeros create a wall near the edge to maximize space.</i></p>

<i><p align=center>There are 2 more details to this pattern.</i></p>

<i><p align=center>If a player fails a <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> he will spawn a puddle under him. This can happen only one time to each player.  
Sometimes he also spawns clones whenever you fail a <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> but can't figure out exactly when it happens. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't (my incompetence or smilegate incompetence)</i></p>

<i><p align=center><code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> itself can be delayed.</i></p>

<i><p align=center>Not delayed</i></p>

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Gifs/raw/refs/heads/main/G1/Phase_2/Guard_P2_Normal_VID.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>Delayed</i></p>

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Gifs/raw/refs/heads/main/G1/Phase_2/Guard_P2_Delayed_VID.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center><code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> timing depends on his spear rotation, not on the blink.  
The moment he rotates his spear he will perform thrust.  
That's what you have to <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code>.</i></p>

## <ins>Shield</ins>

<p align=justify>This is a DPS check that requires you to break through Kazeros shield before he does a raid wipe. It is timestoppable if you fail.</p>

<p align=justify>Kazeros shields himself with a 24,4 billion hp shield that needs to be destroyed in ~10 seconds. During this pattern he also spawns 4 times line explosions that spread in a star shape and requires <code style="color : Fuchsia">co-op counter</code> after the first explosion.</p>

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Gifs/raw/refs/heads/main/G1/Phase_2/Shield_VID.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>The pattern lasts longer than it shows even if you manage to finish it earlier. That means its a free dps pattern if you have enough dmg to quickly burst through it. But that also means its harder to recognize if you managed to destroy it in time.  
In hell brel cube mech sometimes you were too late with stagger which caused a wipe. It's the same thing with a shield which will cause a wipe even if you destroy it, but you did it too late.</i></p>

<i><p align=center>If you dont make it in time there is a different animation before raid wipe happens that you can timestop.</i></p>

    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Gifs/raw/refs/heads/main/G1/Phase_2/Shield_Fail_VID.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>Timing for timestop is just before the orb reaches Kazeros hand.</i></p>

<i><p align=center>There is one more thing to watch out for and its the puddles that spawn only during the first explosion which can mess up <code style="color : Fuchsia">co-op counter</code>.</i></p>
