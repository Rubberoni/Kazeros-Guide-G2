# <ins>Mechs</ins>

<p align=justify>This sections explains all the mechs that happen in g2-3.</p>

<p align=justify>This gate also has meter pattern which is the same as in g2-2. That means, just like in thaemine, it will trasfer over any left over meter from the previous gate. Iirc it counts during cutscene as well so might want to use that to your advantage.</p>

## <ins>Spotlight</ins>

<p align=justify>This mech happens around every 2 minutes and 30 seconds.</p>

<p align=justify>Kazeros will cover whole map in black fog. 7 people will be targeted by his clones while 1 person will be targeted by Kazeros himself. That person will have a pillar of light coming out of him.</p>

<p align=justify>Clones will perform small dash into cleave towards the players while Kazeros will either do a <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> or a <code style="color : Blue">counter</code> pattern that must be taken care of by the player who's targeted by him. This whole gimmick will repeat 4 times and will kill any person who fails it.</p>

<i><p align=center>During this mech everyone spreads around to avoid overlapping clones. Person being targeted by the Kazeros will have to check which motion Kazeros to differentiate between a <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> and a <code style="color : Blue">counter</code>.</i></p>

## <ins>DPS Check  (75%)</ins>

<p align=justify>This is just a DPS check which requires you to deal enough damage to get rid of additional bar bellow his hp. This mech activates at 75% of his hp and will give you additional time if you manage to clear it.</p>
