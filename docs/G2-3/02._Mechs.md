# <ins>Mechs</ins>

<p align=justify>This sections explains all the mechs that happen in g2-3.</p>

<p align=justify>This gate also has a meter pattern which is the same as in g2-2. That means, just like in thaemine, it will transfer over any left over meter from the previous gate. Iirc it counts during cutscene as well so might want to use that to your advantage.</p>

## <ins>Spotlight</ins>

<p align=justify>This mech happens around every 2 minutes and 30 seconds.</p>

<p align=justify>Kazeros will cover whole map in black fog. 7 people will be targeted by his clones while 1 person will be targeted by Kazeros himself. That person will have a pillar of light coming out of him.</p>

<p align=justify>Clones will perform small dash into cleave towards the players while Kazeros will either do a <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> or a <code style="color : Blue">counter</code> pattern that must be taken care of by the player who's targeted by him. This whole gimmick will repeat 4 times and will kill any person who fails it.</p>

<i><p align=center>During this mech everyone spreads around to avoid overlapping clones. Person being targeted by the Kazeros will have to check which motion Kazeros to differentiate between a <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> and a <code style="color : Blue">counter</code>.</i></p>

<p align=justify>1. Guard</p>

<i><p align=center>You can look at the way Kazeros is holding his sword.</i></p>

<i><p align=center><code style="color : Blue">counter</code></i></p>

## <ins>DPS Check  (75%)</ins>

<p align=justify>This is just a DPS check which requires you to deal enough damage to get rid of additional bar bellow his hp. This mech activates at 75% of his hp and will give you additional time if you manage to clear it.</p>

## <ins>Elgic stagger(50%)</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros will grab one person and push him towards the other side of the arena. After that he will slowly walk towards him while exploding around. You have to stagger him before he reaches that person.</p>

<i><p align=center>Order of the patterns in this one:  
Explosion -> explosion -> <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> -> explosion -> <code style="color : Fuchsia">co-op counter</code> -> explosion -> explosion
All of the explosions can be random, as in you are not guaranteed to get the exactly same shape of explosion every time in the same order.
Third explosion that happens after the <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> is not consistent. In clip above it was sides without an indicator, but on the other one it was a normal yellow side explosion.</i></p>

## <ins>Fake death (25%)</ins>

<p align=justify>The final mech and a finish line. During it all you want to do is use everything you have and hit the boss as hard as you can. Its a fake dps check that will kill everyone at the end and revive them. Everything will come off cd after you get revived.</p>

<i><p align=center>The moment he ascends is the timing for a hidden sidereal. If you dont want to use it hovewer i will also explain how the last last mech works (or if you lack damage to kill him during it).</i></p>

## <ins>Rotating pizza (0% < x < 25%)</ins>

<p align=justify>This one seems simple on paper, but execution gets a little bit tricky.</p>

<p align=justify>At the start Kazeros will split arena into 2 diferent colours. The colour you get hit by is the one which will be your safe spot for the whole mech.</p>

<p align=justify>After that he will start spawning cones of 2 different colours and you have to avoid the opposite one. After 4 waves like that he will start rotating as well.</p>

<p align=justify>Now here comes the tricky part. At the start of this mech he split arena into 2 colours. It did 2 things:</p>

* Marked you with the colours you need to stick with
* Showed you on which part of the arena you have to stay

[last mech](https://youtu.be/hVMtggRqIik?si=pTPQXgLlnpc8tzsK&t=1741) - clip because the whole mech is too long and quality will be too bad to see what's happening.

<p align=justify>You can notice in the clip, that the halfed arenas did not dissapear. They are always there, but hidden bellow the pizza cones. That means you not only have to stick with your colour on the CONE. You also have to make sure that you stay on your HALF of the arena. Now where is the tricky part?</p>

<p align=justify>During the rotation.</p>

<p align=justify>Your safe half will be rotating around the Kazeros while he also spawns cones around. That means you have to rotate with it constantly and also lookout for the safe cones. Not only that - during this whole mech you HAVE to attack him. It wont end otherwise.</p>
