# <ins>Mechs</ins>

<p align=justify>This sections explains all the mechs that happen in g2-3.</p>

<p align=justify>This gate also has a meter pattern which is the same as in g2-2. That means, just like in thaemine, it will transfer over any left over meter from the previous gate. It counts during cutscene as well so might want to use that to your advantage.</p>

## <ins>Spotlight</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 
<p align=justify>This mech happens around every 2 minutes and 30 seconds.</p>

<p align=justify>Kazeros will cover whole map in black fog. 7 people will be targeted by his clones while 1 person will be targeted by Kazeros himself. That person will be in spotlight (bright light pillar above him).</p>

<p align=justify>Clones will perform small dash into cleave towards the players while Kazeros will either do a <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> or a <code style="color : Blue">counter</code> pattern that must be taken care of by the player who's targeted by him. This whole gimmick will repeat 4 times and will kill any person who fails it.</p>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>

<p align=justify>During this mech everyone spreads around to avoid overlapping clones. Person being targeted by the Kazeros will have to check which motion Kazeros does to differentiate between a <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> and a <code style="color : Blue">counter</code>.</p>

<p align=justify>1. Guard</p>

<p align=justify>2. Counter</p>

<p align=justify>You can look at the way Kazeros is holding his sword.</p>

<i><p align=center><code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code></p></i>

<i><p align=center><code style="color : Blue">counter</code></p></i>

<p align=center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/main/G2-3%20Clips/Sword%20above.jpg"></p>

<p align=justify>Another way to identify which one is it is to sidestep when he appears. <code style="color : Darkorange">Guard</code> version will follow your movement while the <code style="color : Blue">counter</code> will lock on to your starting position.</p>
<p align=justify>Its important to know that Kazeros <code style="color : Blue">counter</code> pattern will knock you down in TFM which means you have to sidestep it first.</p>
<p align=justify>To easly dodge the clones just wait for them to appear and then move into one direction. They lock on to your starting position.</p>

## <ins>DPS Check  (75%)</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 
<p align=justify>This is just a DPS check which requires you to deal enough damage to get rid of additional bar bellow his hp. This mech activates at 75% of his hp and will give you additional time if you manage to clear it. Use Armen and recast as well.</p>

## <ins>Sacrifice(40%)</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 
<p align=justify>Kazeros will spawn an orb far away in front of him. One person has to enter it to activate a stagger mech. After that he will slowly walk towards him while exploding around. You have to stagger him before he reaches that person.</p>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>
<p align=justify>Order of the patterns in this one:</p>
<p align=justify>Explosion -> explosion -> <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> -> explosion -> <code style="color : Fuchsia">co-op counter</code> -> explosion -> explosion.</p>
<p align=justify>All of the explosions can be random, as in you are not guaranteed to get the exactly same shape of explosion every time.</p>
<p align=justify>Third explosion that happens after the <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> is not consistent. In clip above it was front/back without an indicator, but on the other one it was a normal yellow side explosion. To safely avoid it always position yourself on sides of the Kazeros after the <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code>.</i></p>

## <ins>Fake death (25%->10%)</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 
<p align=justify>The final mech and a finish line. During it all you want to do is use everything you have and hit the boss as hard as you can. Its a fake dps check that will kill everyone at the end and revive them. Everything will come off cd after you get revived.</p>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>
<p align=justify>His HP always gets recuded during it from 25% to 10% which means any damage that you deal to him during it doesnt matter. All you want is to blast everything right after Vairgrys revives you.</i></p>
<p align=justify>The moment he ascends is the timing for a hidden sidereal. If you dont want to use it hovewer i will also explain how the last last mech works (or if you lack damage to kill him during it).</i></p>

## <ins>Rotating pizza (0% < x < 25%)</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 
<p align=justify>This one seems simple on paper, but execution gets a little bit tricky.</p>

<p align=justify>At the start Kazeros will split arena into 2 diferent colours. The colour you get hit by is the one which will be your safe spot for the whole mech.</p>

<p align=justify>After that he will start spawning cones of 2 different colours and you have to avoid the opposite one. After 2 explosions he will change position of arena splits. He will repeat this sequence 2 times and then he will start rotating as well.</p>

</video>

<p align=justify>Now here comes the tricky part. At the start of this mech he split arena into 2 colours. It did 2 things:</p>

* Marked you with the colours you need to stick with
* Showed you on which part of the arena you have to stay

[last mech](https://youtu.be/hVMtggRqIik?si=pTPQXgLlnpc8tzsK&t=1741) - clip because the whole mech is too long and quality will be too bad to see what's happening.

<p align=justify>You can notice in the clip, that the halfed arenas did not dissapear. They are always there, but hidden bellow the pizza cones. That means you not only have to stick with the cone that has your starting colour. You also have to make sure that you stay on your half of the arena. Now where is the tricky part?</p>

<p align=justify>During the rotation.</p>

<p align=justify>Your safe half will be rotating around the Kazeros while he also spawns cones around. That means you have to rotate with it constantly and also lookout for the safe cones. Not only that - during this whole mech you have to attack him. It wont end otherwise.</p>

<p align=justify>Some infographic:</p>

<p align=center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/main/G2-3%20Clips/Last%20mech.jpg"></p>

<p align=justify>If you started on blue, your safe spots will be on the left side on blue parts. If you started on yellow, your safe spots will be on the right side on yellow parts.</p>
<p align=justify>If you get hit then you receive a debuff that makes you die after 10 seconds. If that happens just try to deal as much damage as possible before you die. You cant survive it even with Crisis.</p>
