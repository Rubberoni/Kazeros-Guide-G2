# <ins>Normal Patterns</ins>

<p align=justify>This sections explains normal patterns that Kazeros uses during gate 2-3.</p>

<p align=justify>He is using some patterns from the previous gate as well as a new ones. Cant list exactly which patterns are from the previous gate, because there are not enough vods from g2-3 to determine it (also im lazy).</p>
