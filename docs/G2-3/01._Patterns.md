# <ins>Normal Patterns</ins>

<p align=justify>This sections explains normal patterns that Kazeros uses during gate 2-3. Because i havent watched that many g2-3's (<10) dont except every pattern to be 100% the same. What i mean by that, is the aggro might be different, or maybe boss is focusing one person during the pattern and he might rotate. Use these as a guideline and if you find out the pattern works slightly different than what is written here, let me know.</p>

<p align=justify>I can say for sure that both of his clash patterns exist in this gate so beware of that.</p>
  
## <ins>Out-in Spin</ins>

<p align=justify>This pattern consists of 3 motions, with each one of them creating an explosion.In order:</p>
<p align=justify>360 spin (out safe) ->  Front cleave -> Front line -> 360 spin (in safe)</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>He is targeting one player during this whole pattern, which means his cleave + line will be targeted at him.</i></p>

## <ins>Mirrors</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros covers whole arena in a white fog except for the zone around him. He then creates mirrors around him that shoot out delayed, fast moving projectiles.</p>

<i><p align=center>Para immunity is enough to not get pushed around.  
Damage of that pattern is not that high, but it does inflict -10% atk power debuff that can stack up to 5 (non cleansable).</i></p>

## <ins>Medusa</ins>

<p align=justify>This pattern has 2 variations depending if its look-in or look-out medusa. After either of those Kazeross will require a <code style="color : Blue">counter</code>.</p>

<p align=justify>1. Look in</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>Creates a yellow swirl towards him. Look at him during that.</i></p>

<p align=justify>2. Look out</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>Creates a black swirl away from him. Look away during that.</i></p>

<i><p align=center>If you get hit by it you will get blinded, massively slowed and pulled in. Slow prevents you from countering the boss.</i></p>

## <ins>Big Orbs</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros summons 6 big orbs around him and then charges towards 1 person 2 times destroying any orbs he comes in contact with on the way. After that he requires a <code style="color : Fuchsia">co-op counter</code>.</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>You want to bait him out to make sure he doesnt destroy more than 1 orb - they create large dot on the ground.</i></p>

## <ins>Pizza stagger</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros progresively covers more area around him with cones. In total there will be 3 waves of cones that linger for the duration of the stagger.</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>They deal a lot of damage so you want to avoid them during staggering.</i></p>

## <ins>Blink Guard</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros dissapears and reappears with a <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> 2 times after which he slams 1 person creating a lingering cross explosion which deals massive damage.</p>

</video>

## <ins>Trinity</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros covers whole map with a black fog except for the small zone around him. He will then rotate around with 3 beams shooting out of him and orbs passing through that can push you out. After that he will create expanding explosions starting from inside.</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>You want to dash in at the end or just use push immune with DR from support.</i></p>

## <ins>Waffle counter</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros covers whole map in lines which explode and them dissapears and reappears with a <code style="color : Blue">counter</code>.</p>

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-3%20Clips/G2-3_Wave_Counter.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>If you get hit by any of the explosions it will send you flying for the remaining duration of the pattern.  
You can push immune it, but it will also inflict massive slow which will prevent you from <code style="color : Blue">countering</code></i></p>

## <ins>Rain</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros spawns a homing orb on 1 player. At the same time he summons rain on top of all players followed by a front cleave and 2 side cleaves (one side into another). After that he requires a <code style="color : Fuchsia">co-op counter</code>.</p>

</video>

## <ins>Charge</ins>

<p align=justify>Simillar pattern to 'Guard charge' from g2-2, but there is no <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> this time. Instead he dashes through you without dealing damage (shield just in case, not fully sure about that one, sometimes people take damage) and then beams one person.</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>You can walk out of it if you dont want to be sent flying, but it will inflict 'HP blindness on you' (cant see your hp) and it does heavy dot damage.</i></p>
