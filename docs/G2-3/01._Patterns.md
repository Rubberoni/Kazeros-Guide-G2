</video>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>
<p align=justify>He is targeting one player during this whole pattern, which means his cleave + line will be targeted at him.</i></p>
<p align=justify>Damage comes only from his explosions so you dont have to worry about getting hit from him swinging his sword around. You can just walk out of every explosion by running around him.</i></p>
<p align=justify>You need push immunity to greed on this pattern.</i></p>

## <ins>Mirrors</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 
<p align=justify>Kazeros covers whole arena in a white fog except for the zone around him. He then creates mirrors around him that shoot delayed, fast moving projectiles.</p>

</video>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>
<p align=justify>Para immunity is enough to not get pushed around.</p>
<p align=justify>Damage of that pattern is not that high, but it does inflict -10% atk power debuff that can stack up to 5 (non cleansable).</p>

## <ins>Medusa</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 
<p align=justify>This pattern has 2 variations depending if its look-in or look-out medusa. After either of those Kazeros will dash around 3 times and then require a <code style="color : Blue">counter</code> from the direction he dashed toward to. There is no medusa in Hard - only <code style="color : Blue">counter</code>.</p>

<p align=justify>1. Look in</p>

<p align=justify>Creates a yellow swirl towards him. Look at him during that.</p>

<p align=justify>2. Look out</p>

</video>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>
<p align=justify>If you get hit by it you will get blinded, massively slowed and pulled in. Slow prevents you from countering the boss.</p>

## <ins>Big Orbs</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 
<p align=justify>Kazeros summons 6 big orbs around him and then charges towards 1 person 3 times destroying any orbs he comes in contact with on the way. After that he requires a <code style="color : Fuchsia">co-op counter</code>.</p>

</video>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>
<p align=justify>You want to bait him out to make sure he doesnt destroy more than 1 orb - they create a large puddle that deals damage to anyone standing on it.</i></p>

## <ins>Pizza stagger</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 
<p align=justify>Kazeros progresively covers more area around him with cones. First yellow indicator showing its position and then it gets covered in black fog dealing DOT while you are standing on it. In total there will be 3 waves of cones that linger for the duration of stagger.</p>

</video>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>
<p align=justify>They deal a lot of damage so you want to avoid them during staggering.</p>
<p align=justify>If you fail the stagger Kazeros will do a raid wide damage. You have to DR it in hard to survive (not sure if you can in TFM).</p>

## <ins>Blink Guard</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 
<p align=justify>Kazeros dissapears and reappears with a <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> 2 times after which he targets 1 person and shoots out a projectiles towards him which explode into a lingering cross explosion if it connects.</p>

</video>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>
<p align=justify>Make sure to see who he is targeting after guarding. Cross deals infinite damage in TFM and you can completely get rid of it by not getting hit with a projectile.</p>
<p align=justify>You want to stay bit further away from him and sidestep it the moment he locks on to your position. Make sure to not stand on top of him/right behind him either before he shoots it. Its hitbox reaches his back.</p>

## <ins>Trinity</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 
<p align=justify>Kazeros covers whole map with a black fog except for the small zone around him. He will then rotate around with 3 beams shooting out of him and orbs passing through that can push you out/towards middle. After that he will create expanding explosions starting from inside.</p>

    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-3%20Clips/G2-3_Trinity.mp4">
</video>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>
<p align=justify>You want to dash in at the end or just use push immune with DR from support.</p>
<p align=justify>You also want to eat as many orbs as you can using skills with at least para immunity to minimize the risk of them hitting other people.</p>  

## <ins>Waffle counter</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 
<p align=justify>Kazeros covers whole map in lines which explode and them disappears and reappears with a <code style="color : Blue">counter</code>.</p>

    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-3%20Clips/G2-3_Wave_Counter.mp4">
</video>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>
<p align=justify>If you get hit by any of the explosions it will send you flying for the remaining duration of the pattern. You can push immune it, but it will also inflict massive slow which will prevent you from <code style="color : Fuchsia">co-op countering</code>.</p>
<p align=justify>He reappears behind one random person.</p>

## <ins>Rain</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 
<p align=justify>Kazeros spawns a homing orb on 1 player. At the same time he summons rain on top of all players followed by a front cleave and 2 side cleaves (one side into another). After that he requires a <code style="color : Fuchsia">co-op counter</code>.</p>

</video>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>
<p align=justify>This pattern is extremely dangerous and its just advised to outrange it. You can slowly return a bit after he begins his <code style="color : Fuchsia">co-op countering</code> animation.</p>

## <ins>Charge</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 
<p align=justify>Simillar pattern to 'Guard charge' from g2-2, but there is no <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> this time. Instead you want to space out just before his charge (you can look at his sword, after it blinks he will charge). After that he will beam any people who get hit it. If no one gets hit he wont do a beam.</p>

</video>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>
<p align=justify>If you go out too early you will get inflicted with slow and HP blindness. Fog also deals DOT as long as you are standing in it.</p>
<p align=justify>You can also timestop this pattern and it wont count as getting hit.</p>
