# <ins>Normal Patterns</ins>

<p align=justify>This section explains normal patterns that Kazeros uses in Phase 3.  
There are new ones as well as enhanced or changed versions of previous ones.</p>

<p align=justify>This Phase is extremely dangerous and the hardest out of all 3 so you want to make sure that you have as much time as possible in this gate. There are lots of downtime patterns</p>

<p align=justify>This phase reintroduces <code style="color : Purple">gauge</code> again with the same <code style="color : Purple">special patterns</code> and 1 new.  
It changes how it behaves, by never resetting after filling up to full and instead staying for the rest of the fight.  
That means he will be able to do <code style="color : Purple">special patterns</code> as his normal ones, BUT it only applies to <code style="color : Purple">X</code>. That's the only one that he starts using from that point.</p>

<p align=justify>There is also one thing (which might be a bug, who knows). He can do <code style="color : Purple">X</code> as his normal pattern sometimes, not related to <code style="color : Purple">gauge</code> BEFORE he reaches 100%. It rarely happens, but it is a thing. Beware of that if it doesn't get changed.</p>

## <ins>Repeat of previous patterns</ins>

<p align=justify>These are the patterns from previous phases:</p>

* [Right/Left](../Phase_1/01._Patterns.md/#right-left)
* [Spin Guard](../Phase_1/01._Patterns.md/#spin-guard)
* [Lauriel](../Phase_2/01._Patterns.md/#lauriel)
* [Orbs (this time orbs spawn on 8 people and it is a normal pattern instead of being HP based)](../Phase_1/02._Post_900X.md/#orbs)
* [Donut/star](../Phase_1/02._Post_900X.md/#shield-debuff)

## <ins> Ascend v2</ins>

<p align=justify>Ascend now spawns puddles below every player at the start instead. After Kazeros disappears he drops on top of 1 player and spawns donut explosions just like in the regular version.</p>

<i><p align=center>You can track his movement by checking the minimap. That’s where he will reappear.</i></p>

## <ins>Wall v2</ins>

<p align=justify>Wall from Phase 2 is changed. Now it has only 1 variation and its the 'Wall combo'.  
Instead of <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> pattern that happens right after, it got replaced by 8 clones that spawn on cardinals and intercardinals.  
All of them do a thrust attack towards middle.  
Beside that Kazeros still spawns wall blocking off part of the map.</p>

## <ins>Tornado charge</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros spawns tornadoes on 4 different players and sends a singular line of explosions forward. After that he dashes backwards while also sending 6 additional lines, 3 per side in a 60 degree cone. Then he <code style="color : Red">aggroes</code> onto one person and thrust him with his spear.</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>He locks on the target and after a bit stops following him. You can move out of the way if you are fast or just spacebar to be safe.  
There is also an indicator showing if you are the one being targeted just like during 'Aggro Guard', but currently sometimes it doesn't show. If it's not fixed till our release beware of that.</p></i>

## <ins>Xayah</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros <code style="color : Red">aggroes</code> one person and starts sending vertical slashes toward him. At the same time at the end of their travel (or if the player gets hit) it spawns the shadow.  
After the final slash Kazeros will do one more horizontal slash with a larger hitbox followed by attacks from all shadows towards the targeted person (this one is unsure, check lower).  
You might remember a similar version of this pattern from Thaemine, when he disappears and does a slash followed by attacks from all of his clones.</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>He does a small frontal cleave and cloaks himself in black mist. That's how you can recognize it.  
Sometimes shadows can target other players. This one I still don't fully understand so just beware of that. Might be when somebody else gets hit, but didn't look consistent enough to prove that.</p></i>

## <ins>Wings</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros folds his left wing and does a back cleave that leaves lingering explosions.</p>

## <ins>Portals</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros spawns 6 portals around him that send a wave towards him. Hitbox is a bit misleading, there is no safe spot around Kazeros.</p>

## <ins>Line</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros throws a spear into the ground in front of him and makes a line which explodes, that goes through his front and back.  
He then follows up with expanding lines towards his sides while also requiring stagger.  
After the stagger he will do 180-200 side cleave on his right side. His left side being the safe spot.  
Its very similar pattern to Act 2 G1 when he slams his back with his tail, followed up by explosions going sideways.</p>

</video>

## <ins>Guard charge</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros makes a <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> by charging forward and disappears while spawning 6 clones charging outwards from his position. Then he reappears behind 1 player and cleaves in front.</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>Clones spawn is a bit unintuitive.  
They spawn from the position just behind Kazeros, not on top of him. It's always relative to where he is facing. 2 of them charge towards left/right while the other 4 towards intercardinals.</p></i>

## <ins>Pizza</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros <code style="color : Red">aggroes</code> one person and lunges at him. He then spawns 4 pizzas from that position.  
He also spawns a flame that follows one player during this pattern and leaves a lingering path behind it that gives any player that touches it a debuff that inverts your movement for 1 second.  
You can see the debuff above your mana (shuriken on the character model) if you are targeted by Kazeros.</p>

<i><p align=center>Flame that spawns targets 1 player and follows him in a straight line by locking onto him. It can change directions only 3 times including starting movement.</p></i>

## <ins>Zig-Zag</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros dashes right and left alternating between those 2 aiming at the middle.  
Whenever he hits a person with one of his dashes it will spawn blades on top of him that go outwards.  
His final dash also ends up in an aoe explosion on top of him.</p>

<i><p align=center>Kazeros will do this pattern when he is too close to the wall or he wants to reposition for 100x mech.</p></i>
