# <ins>Kazeros guide</ins>

<p align=justify>Welcome to the guide that was made specificaly for my static usage.</p>

<p align=justify>Its the first time i've ever created something like this so expect issues/slow loading times/weird formating, etc.</p>

<p align=justify>Everything was created by me, Rubberino, my friend Armadillo, and also with the help of a few other people.</p>

<p align=justify>Big thanks to the people who were streaming the whole time so i could watch multiple vods of prog:</p>

* Saintone
* Cracinee

<p align=justify>I hope this guide will help you with clearing Kazeros.</p>

<p align=justify>Just a warning tho - it was made purely based on The First mode so i dont know what's different compared to the normal/hard version.</p>

<p align=justify>I will revisit it later to fix any issues that this guide might have related to patterns (you can also let me know if there is anything missing/wrong).</p>

<p align=justify>Videos don't have any sounds, because my music taste is sometimes questionable.</p>

## <ins>Quick info</ins>
