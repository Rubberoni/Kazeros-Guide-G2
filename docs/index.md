[G1](https://rubberoni.github.io/Kazeros-guide/)

<p align=justify>Made it to help my static, but feel free to use it now that the race is delayed anyway.</p>

<p align=justify>Everything was created by Rubberino, my friend Armadillo, and also with the help of a few other people.</p>

<p align=justify>Big thanks to the people who were streaming the whole time so i could watch multiple vods of prog:</p>

* Saintone
* Cracinee

<p align=justify>I hope this guide will help you with clearing Kazeros.</p>

<p align=justify>Just a warning tho - it was made purely based on The First mode so i dont know what's different compared to the normal/hard version.</p>

<p align=justify>I will revisit it later to fix any issues that this guide might have related to patterns (you can also let me know if there is anything missing/wrong).</p>

## <ins>Quick info</ins>

<p align=justify>Guide is split into 3 sections:</p>

* G2-1 - Patterns and Mechs from 1st 'gate'
* G2-2 - Patterns and Mechs from 2nd 'gate'
* G2-3 - Patterns and Mechs from 3rd 'gate'
