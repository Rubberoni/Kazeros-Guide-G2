# <ins>Kazeros guide</ins>

<p align=justify>Welcome to the Kazeros G2 guide. Might not be as detailed, because i burnt out a bit (Loooots of patterns), but can explain stuff if needed. If you want to see G1 click link below.</p>

[G1](https://rubberoni.github.io/Kazeros-guide/)

<p align=justify>Made it to help my static, but feel free to use it now that the race is delayed anyway.</p>

<p align=justify>Everything was created by Rubberino, my friend Armadillo, and also with the help of a few other people.</p>

<p align=justify>Big thanks to the people who were streaming the whole time so i could watch multiple vods of prog:</p>

* Saintone
* Cracinee

<p align=justify>Make sure to check out SeoNee guide for this gate as well. Extremely helpful.</p>

<p align=justify>I hope this guide will help you with clearing Kazeros.</p>

<p align=justify>Just a warning tho - it was made purely based on The First mode so i dont know what's different compared to the normal/hard version (included some changes already).</p>

<p align=justify>I will revisit it later to fix any issues that this guide might have related to patterns (you can also let me know if there is anything missing/wrong).</p>

<p align=justify>If something doesnt load - refresh. Github issues (unless its my fault, but refreshing 1 time means its a github).</p>

<p align=justify>Never done anything like this before so take it easy on me c:</p>
