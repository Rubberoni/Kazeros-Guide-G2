<i><p align=center>He stands in place and creates walls on the both side with front/back safe.</i></p>

<i><p align=center>To differentiate this pattern you need to look at his hands. Red glowing hands with side motion indicates the pattern while the follow-up motion indicates the variation.  
Front wall - always starts with a back dash (easiest one)  
Back wall - he spreads his hands 2 times  
Side wall - he spreads his hands 1 time</i></p>
