# <ins>Normal Patterns</ins>

<p align=justify>Gratz for reaching this phase. Now the real fun begins.</p>

<p align=justify>This sections explains normal patterns that Kazeros uses throughout the whole g2-2.</p>

## <ins>Burrow</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros burrows himself and reappears in another location requiring a <code style="color : Fuchsia">co-op counter</code>.</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>He deals damage during the burrow and unburrow knocking people.</i></p>

## <ins>Blink counter</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros dissapears and reappears with a <code style="color : Blue">counter</code></p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>You can follow his movement with minimap/bleed rune.  
If you fail the <code style="color : Blue">counter</code> he will deal damage in front of him.</i></p>

</video>

## <ins>Blink Co-op counter</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros will do a blink into cleave 2 times followed by a <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> into a <code style="color : Fuchsia">co-op counter</code>.</p>

    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-2%20Clips/G2-2_Blink_Co-Op.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>If you failed <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> then the <code style="color : Fuchsia">co-op counter</code> will not appear, which means you cant stop him from doing 360 AOE.</i></p>

</video>

## <ins>Barrage Missiles</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros targets one person and slides towards one direction while sending barrage of missiles towards 5(?) players. After that he spawns orb in front of him towards targeted player. Then he repeats the same pattern while targeting another player.</p>

</video>

## <ins>Clones</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros spawns 8 clones - 3 of the same colour and 5 of the other. Safe spot will be the clones which count is smaller, while the others will thrust forward. After that orb will spawn inside of the clones shoting rotating beams. Then Kazeros will appear with lots of 2 coloured cuts around the map.</p> 

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-2%20Clips/G2-2_Clones.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>If you managed to hide in safe spot you can ignore the cuts. If you failed then you have to stand in the same colour as the clones that were safe (i think? Will test on hard).  
This pattern has 2 variations with the only changing factor being the colour of clones. Execution is the same.</i></p>

## <ins>4 Black Orbs</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros will cover whole map with black fog which deals heavy damage except for the zone around him. He will then pull players towards him and spawn 2 or 4 black orbs around him that will try to push players outside of the safe zone. They also explode at the and of their movement, which means if they do push you out, you will die to the combination of their explosion + fog.

</video>

<i><p align=center>You can use para immunity to prevent being pushed out. The orbs themselves dont deal that much except for the final explosion.</i></p>

## <ins>Spin</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros will dash towards one direction and then towards a diferent one. After that he will do 360 spin spawning pizza cones around him rotating clockwise.</p>

</video>

## <ins>Orbs</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros spawns multiple small orbs around that merge into big ones and then explode.</p>

    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-2%20Clips/G2-2_Lauriel.mp4">
</video>

## <ins>Grab</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros pulls players in with 2 explosions - first one being in safe, second one being out safe. After 2nd one he will dash forward and if he managed to grab somebody he will pin that person to the ground creating donut explosion around him.</p> 

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-2%20Clips/G2-2_Grab.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>If he doesnt grab anyone then he wont do a pin down.</i></p>

</video>


## <ins>Guard Charge</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros covers map with black fog except for his front and back. After a brief moment he will charge forward with a <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> animation.</p> 

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-2%20Clips/G2-2_Guard_Charge.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>You have to stay in front of him to perform a <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code>. If you fail it, after a few seconds you will create lingering explosion under you which will proc QTE for anyone that steps into it.</i></p>

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-2%20Clips/G2-2_Guard_Charge_Caught.mp4">
</video>


## <ins>Triple Guard</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros will perform 4 motions with the initial 3 being <code style="color : Darkorange">guards</code>. AOE explosion around him -> Cleave front -> cleave back -> Rotating cones around him.</p> 

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-2%20Clips/G2-2_Triple_Guard.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>Cones do not reach his back.  
If you get hit by his first AOE you will get inflicted with a 'blind'. Its a debuff that makes you unable to see indicators for patterns (or in case of TFM - indicators for <code style="color : Darkorange">guards</code>).</i></p>

</video>

## <ins>Walls</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros spawns 3 s that will charge forward after a brief moment and drag any players along the way.</p> 

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-2%20Clips/G2-2_Walls.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>You can use para immunity to not get dragged forward.  
To see which way walls with charge you have to pay attention to 'waves' that comes out of them. They indicate direction of the charge.  
If you do get dragged along with them boss will charge towards you.</i></p>

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-2%20Clips/G2-2_Wall_Follow.mp4">
</video>

## <ins>Vortex</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros will transform into vortex traveling randomly around the map, spawning around black puddles with a safe spot being on top of him. If you leave the safe spot or get hit by a black puddle you will get dragged towards with him. After that he will drop on top of that person with safe spot being out and then in.</p> 

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-2%20Clips/G2-2_Vortex.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>Not getting dragged with Kazeros will allow you more time to get away from out safe explosion.</i></p>

## <ins>Stack</ins>

<p align=justify>4 people will drop large aoes under them after a few seconds. Kazeros will also descend behind them ans spawn cones coming out of him which immobilize any players who get hit.</p> 

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-2%20Clips/G2-2_Stack.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>You want to stack with each other to allow you to easier avoid upcoming cones.</i></p>

## <ins>Stagger walk</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros will cover whole map in black fog except for small area around him. He will then start to walk forward while spawning yellow pillars around him that activate after a moment and immobilize any players getting hit by them. During this walk you have to stagger him.</p> 

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-2%20Clips/G2-2_Stagger_Walk.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>The pillars have 2 hits - the moment they activate and the moment they desactivate. Other than that you should be able to safely walk through them.(?)  
If you manage to fail the stagger check, Kazeros will fire beam in front of him.</i></p>

    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-2%20Clips/G2-2_Stagger_Walk_Fail.mp4">
</video>

## <ins>Slow flight</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros will slowly fly around the map spawning lines all over the place which deal damage. After 2 sets of them he will then throw his sword in front of him which explodes in large area. This pattern has 2 variations.</p> 

<p align=justify>1. No cone</p> 

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-2%20Clips/G2-2_Slow_Flight_No_Cone.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>This one does a small knockback and imprisons any players hit by it. You should stack together and throw a splendid sacred bomb to avoid it.</i></p>

<p align=justify>2. Cone</p> 

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-2%20Clips/G2-2_Slow_Flight_Cone.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>Just hide in a cone.</i></p>

## <ins>Orbital striket</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros cover whole map in AOE explosions and performs 2 <code style="color : Darkorange">guards</code> during it. If you fail a <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> he will pull you towards him and deal high damage which requires shielding/DR.</p> 

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-2%20Clips/G2-2_Orbital_Strike.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>Just hide in a cone.</i></p>

## <ins>Purifier Beam</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros sends forward a beam that will travel towards the edge of the map and explode into a <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> pattern at the end. During that Kazeros will charge forward one of the players 3 times and inflict 'blind' on any targets he hits.</p> 

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-2%20Clips/G2-2_Purifier_Beam.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>You want to get to the other side of the explosion so you can safely out range the <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code>.  
You can accidentaly intercept the beam which will make it stop. This means the <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> will reach you and you will have to deal with it.</i></p>

    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-2%20Clips/G2-2_Clash.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>You activate it by going to the position he is looking at.</i></p>

<p align=justify>2. 'Forced' clash</p> 

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-2%20Clips/G2-2_Forced_Clash.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>This one he 'forces' one player to do it (looks like its the closest one during the start of the animation).</i></p>

<i><p align=center>No clips but failed clash results in raid wide aoe | failed 'forced' clash in 360 spin.</i></p>

## <ins>5 hit combo</ins>

<p align=justify>Deadly pattern that targets one person.</p> 

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">

    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-2%20Clips/G2-2_5_Orbs_Stagger.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>If black count is higher than yellow then you have to stagger.</i></p>

<p align=justify>1. 2 black and 3 yellow</p> 

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-2%20Clips/G2-2_5_Orbs_Counter.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>If yellow count is higher than black then you have to counter.</i></p>
