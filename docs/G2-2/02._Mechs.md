# <ins>Mechs</ins>

<p align=justify>This sections explains all the mechs that happen in g2-2.</p>

## <ins>Angry birds</ins>

<p align=justify>This pattern happens every 2 minutes of the fight.</p>

<p align=justify>Kazeros sends everying flying and covers whole map with black fog except for a few spots. After a moment you will be able to interact with a mouse to choose which direction to fly to. Then Kazeros will send 4 lines toward 4 diferent safepot and perform a guard.</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>Its important to keep Kazeros middle during the fight to avoid bad placement of this one.  
To control where you want to go you have to click and hold mouse towards the opposite direction (reverse movement).  
To find a safe spot you have to look where the boss is facing and check where is the closest safe spot counterclockwise to that direction, ex.: If he is facing 12, safespot will be on 11; if he is facing 5, safe spot will be on 4 etc. Same goes for his back - it will be closest counterclockwise spot to where his back pointed.</i></p>

<i><p align=center>If you fail to do a mouse QTE you will die without a support DR.</i></p>

## <ins>Full meter</ins>

<p align=justify>After Kazeros's meter fills up he teleports middle and cover whole map with lines + puddle explosions. 4 random people gets marked and are chained to each other in pairs. After the timer runs out 2 of those 4 people get chained to each other. If a mech is solved corectly Kazeros will explode one side of the map creating quicksand there which kills any players who step into it.</p>

<i><p align=center>You have to stay chained to the other person for the duration of the timer.  
You also want to avoid playing on the side with quicksand.</i></p>

<i><p align=center>If you fail the mech Kazeros will instead explode 4 sides of the map making it extremely difficult to play.</i></p>

## <ins>600x/150x</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros have 2 specific mechs during this gate that can either take time of your gate or increase it. They happen at 600x and 150x and can never repeat, which means you will get both, but randomly decided which one first.</p>

<p align=justify>1. Elgic counter</p>

<p align=justify>Kazeros will teleport middle and begin a series of <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> and <code style="color : Blue">counters</code>. At the end he does a <code style="color : Fuchsia">co-op counter</code>. Failing it results in a raid wipe.</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>There are 2 variations in TFM:  
2x <code style="color : Blue">Counter</code> -> 2x <code style="color : Darkorange">Guard</code> -> <code style="color : Blue">Counter</code> -> <code style="color : Darkorange">Guard</code> -> <code style="color : Blue">Counter</code> -> <code style="color : Fuchsia">co-op counter</code>  
<code style="color : Darkorange">Guard</code> -> <code style="color : Blue">Counter</code> -> <code style="color : Darkorange">Guard</code> -> 3x <code style="color : Blue">Counter</code> -> <code style="color : Darkorange">Guard</code> -><code style="color : Fuchsia">co-op counter</code>    
Its important to know that you dont refresh your cooldowns during this mech and if you fail a <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> you will get stunned for the remainder of the mech.</i></p>

<p align=justify>2. Elgic Up-Down</p>

<p align=justify>This pattern has 2 variations, but the main idea stays the same. Kazeros will do a <code style="color : Fuchsia">co-op counter</code> and make 3 people fly around with them either staying on the same level, going up or going down. They all end on the same level and their altitude dictates what do you have to do with Kazeros. After they stop moving Kazeros will either glow dark or white.</p>

<p align=justify>2.1 Elgic Down version</p>

<p align=justify>People end up on lower altitude -> you need white Kazeros (he only attacks higher altitude) -> check which color is Kazeros | If white - good, hide behind | If dark - bad, <code style="color : Fuchsia">co-op counter</code> him so he swaps colour and then hide behind.</p>

<p align=justify>2.2 Elgic Up version</p>

<p align=justify>People end up on higher altitude -> you need dark Kazeros (he only attacks lower altitude) -> check which color is Kazeros | If white - bad, <code style="color : Fuchsia">co-op counter</code> him so he swaps colour and then hide behind | If dark - good, hide behind.</p>

<p align=justify>2. Elgic Up-Down</p>

## <ins>500x</ins>

<p align=justify>Just a simple DPS check. Deal enough damage during 1 minute for his additional bear to dissapear. You get additional timer if you manage to do it.</p>

</video>

## <ins>300x</ins>

<p align=justify>Hardest mech in this gate. Kazeros will surround himself with a shield and activate a stagger check. You have to destroy him shield first to be able to deal any stagger at all. During this mech he will spawn lots of diferent explosions that you have to avoid, because of reducing your stagger and damage every time you get hit. There is also gonna be a <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> during all of this.</p>

<p align=justify>You have to stagger him 2 times (he wont get his shield again after the first time you destroy it)</p>
