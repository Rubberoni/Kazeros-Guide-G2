# <ins>Normal Patterns</ins>

<p align=justify>This sections explains normal patterns that Kazeros uses throughout the whole g2-1.</p>

## <ins>Cleave into slash wave</ins>

<p align=justify>Holds spear in his right hand, does a backstep and throws his weapon behind his back and cleaves in front of him. Followed by a wave of moving slashes.</p>

<p align=justify>Then drops the sword behind his back that explodes into another wave - this time splits into 5 different directions.</p>

<p align=justify>Finishes off with a line explosion from the spot where the sword was dropped towards kazeros.</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>During the whole pattern he <code style="color : Red">aggroes</code> on one person. He follows that player with 2 motions:</i></p>

* <i>&emsp; Initial cleave
* &emsp; Wave of slashes</i>

<i><p align=center>After those 2 you can safely reposition without having to worry about hitting your teammates.</i></p>

## <ins>Clones</ins>

<p align=justify>Spins his spear above his head (right hand and swaps to left hand during it) and aggroes one person.</p>

<p align=justify>Then he sends 2-3 clones towards that person which linger for a while.</p>

<p align=justify>After that he will dash towards him and do a spin followed by a front cleave and explosions.</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>It's important to recognize if you are the one who has <code style="color : Red">aggro</code>.  
He rotates 180 after dashing.</i></p>

## <ins>Spin Guard</ins>

He <code style="color : Red">aggroes</code> one person and does a front slash followed by spin <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code>.

</video>

<i><p align=center>You need to <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> if you are near him. It’s a 360 degree radius.</i></p>

## <ins>Ascend</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros ascends and throws his spear right in front of him.</p>

<p align=justify>The initial hit causes an explosion around it followed by 2 more donut explosions that happen after each other.</p>

<p align=justify>After all 3 explosions Kazeros will descend and do a 270 degree cleave.</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>You should always stay away from the first explosion and spacebar in after it.  
You can also wait for the 2nd one to happen if you are too far away.  
Safe spot for cleave is always behind him, but he might rotate during this pattern so look out for</i></p>
  

## <ins>Aggro Guard</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros <code style="color : Red">aggroes</code> one person and hits him with his spear 2 times followed by cleave after. Both of the spear hits are <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code>. If you fail <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> he leaves a flame puddle which deals high DOT.</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>Just before cleave animation finishes, move behind him to avoid damage from it. There are 2  
instances of damage:</i></p>

* &emsp;_Cleave_
* &emsp;_Explosions expanding in cone after cleave_

<i><p align=center>The tell for that pattern are 2 motions:</i></p>

* &emsp;_Holds his left hand in front which gets covered in black shadow_
* &emsp;_He charges his spear behind his back which glows blue_

<i><p align=center>The person who has <code style="color : Red">aggro</code> also gets an icon that counts as a debuff (above mana bar).  
Its only purpose is to make it easier for you to see if you have aggro or not when there are  
multiple people.</i></p>

## <ins>Right Left</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros spins the spear with his right hand and holds it above his right side. After a brief moment he slams that side with his spear creating a ~120 degree cone sized explosion. A few seconds later the same thing happens on the other side, but in a larger radius (180-200).</p>

</video>

## <ins>Grab</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros’s left hand starts glowing blue as he raises it. Blue puddles start spawning around indicating lightnings that will hit them. During this pattern he also chooses one person and <code style="color : Red">aggroes</code> onto him. A moment later he will try to grab and pin him to the ground. If he succeeds he follows up with a line shaped explosion in 6 directions.</p>

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Gifs/raw/refs/heads/main/G1/Patterns/Grab%20VID.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>Lightning puddles spawn always from outside to inside with the middle being a safe spot.  
If you do get grabbed make sure to call for DR. You are guaranteed to get oneshoted or almost  
killed.</i></p>

<i><p align=center>Below is a picture of the explosion shape after getting grabbed.</i></p>

<p align=center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rubberoni/Gifs/main/G1/Images/Grab1.png"></p>

<i><p align=center>The explosion is dependent on boss positioning so it could look like this as well.</i></p>

<p align=center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rubberoni/Gifs/main/G1/Images/Grab2.png"></p>

<i><p align=center>The safe spot will always be on his left/right back side if somebody gets grabbed. If nobody gets  
grabbed you can freely back attack him.</i></p>

## <ins>Spears</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros throws a series of spears in front of him towards one point followed by another series of spears, this time expanding outwards from front. After that he drops meteor in front of him and projectiles in a line on 2 players.</p>

</video>

## <ins>Albion</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros sucks in blue fog, dashes backwards relatively to the person he <code style="color : Red">aggroed</code> and throws spear towards him. He creates a safe zone inside and requires a <code style="color : Fuchsia">co-op counter</code>. After co-op there will be one more <code style="color : Blue">counter</code> needed to succeed the mech.</p>

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Gifs/raw/refs/heads/main/G1/Patterns/Albion%20VID.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>People who <code style="color : Fuchsia">co-op counter</code> will spawn tornadoes (aka puddles) under them so they want to place them on the outer edge of a safe spot. Preferably on the sides so others can safely <code style="color : Blue">counter</code> and positionals can deal damage.</i></p>

<i><p align=center>If you fail the <code style="color : Blue">counter</code> just stack together and let supports DR everybody.</i></p>

## <ins>Flames</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros throws his spear in front of him (always facing down) and starts spawning small flames that rush outside in all directions. Based on the color of flames safe spots will be either on cardinals (if its white flames) or intercardinals (if its blue flames). During this pattern place from which flames are spawning is not safe.</p>

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Gifs/raw/refs/heads/main/G1/Patterns/Flames%20VID.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>He sends 3 waves of flames in pairs. 3 times he will explode the ground and based on the colors of flames you need to either rotate or stay.</i></p>

<p align=center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rubberoni/Gifs/main/G1/Images/Flame1.png"></p>

<p align=center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rubberoni/Gifs/main/G1/Images/Flame2.png"></p>

<i><p align=center>Flames always expand in the same direction, which means you just count how many flames you  see traveling in the same line.  
They will be always in pairs which means every 2 flames explosion spot changes or stays the  same. Example below.</i></p>

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Gifs/raw/refs/heads/main/G1/Patterns/Flames%20Count%20VID.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>You can see 4 blue flames in total next to Kazeros and 2 whites which means safe spots will be 2 times intercardinals and 1 time cardinals in that order.</i></p>

<i><p align=center>2 blue -> 2 blue -> 2 white = intercardinal -> intercardinal -> cardinal</i></p>

<i><p align=center>After that make sure you go inside. There will be expanding explosions outside of the middle safe spot.</i></p>

## <ins>Shadows</ins>
<p align=justify>There are 3 main variations of this pattern</p>

<p align=justify>He lifts up his spear above his head and <code style="color : Red">aggroes</code> on one person. Then he performs 2 slam attacks which have a line hitbox. During this pattern he also spawns 4 shadows that target different players and perform slam with line hitbox.</p>

<p align=justify>If somebody gets hit by his first slam, <code style="color : Red">aggro</code> will not change.</p>

<p align=justify>1. If you get hit by his first slam and dodge the second one he will dash backwards and explode around him with the safe spot being inside next to him.</p>

    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Gifs/raw/refs/heads/main/G1/Patterns/Shadows%201%20hit%20VID.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>There is also a cool interaction when he does this pattern instantly after the 1st slam if there is only a single person alive and he dodges the slam.</i></p>

<p align=justify>2. If you get hit by both of his slams he will follow up with a spin dash at the end.</p>

    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Gifs/raw/refs/heads/main/G1/Patterns/Shadows%202%20hit%20VID.mp4">
</video>

<p align=justify>3. If no one gets hit by his first slam he will change aggro to random person and so will the final spin. That also means if he misses 2 slams he will do dash backward explosion instead of spin</p>

</video>

## <ins>Vortex</ins>
<p align=justify>Kazeros throws spear into the ground in front of him and created multiple vortexes around the map and one on top of the spear. All of them are static, but deal a lot of damage if you walk into them. During that there will also be puddles spawning under the players forcing them to constantly move.</p>

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Gifs/raw/refs/heads/main/G1/Patterns/Vortex%20VID.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>Each player gets 3 sets of puddles that will spawn under them indicated by lightning. After a brief moment it will spawn in a spot where lightning hit.</i></p>

<i><p align=center>This pattern also inflicts extremely irritating debuff which makes you electrocuted for 1 second every 5 seconds.  
There is also one more debuff that makes you explode which inflicts the electrocute to players around you.</i></p>

<i><p align=center>For clarity lets say there are 3 debuffs in this mech:</i></p>

* <b>_&emsp;Electrocute_</b>
* <b>_&emsp;Trigger_</b>
* <b>_&emsp;Explosion_</b>

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Gifs/raw/refs/heads/main/G1/Patterns/Vortex%20electrocute%20VID.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>When you step into lingering puddles that are left from lightnings you will get a **trigger** that lasts 11 seconds.  
It will make you **electrocuted** between 10-11/5-6/0-1 seconds of its duration.  
You can spacebar the **electrocute** itself if you time it just before you get it.  
It's also cleansable, but because you get it 3 times it's not safe to rely on supports with cleansing it.  
It's important to make sure that you avoid those puddles.</i></p>

<i><p align=center>Last debuff is related to the vortex:</i></p>

    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Gifs/raw/refs/heads/main/G1/Patterns/Vortex%20debuff%20VID.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>When you step into it you get lifted into the air and then thrown out.  
The moment you get out of it, it will inflict an **explosion** that lasts 5 seconds.  
It makes you explode around you and inflict the **trigger** debuff on other players.  
It's important to move away from others if you get it.</i></p>
