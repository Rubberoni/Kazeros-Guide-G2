# <ins>Patterns</ins>

<p align=justify>Phase 3, just like phase 2, is a sequence of patterns that repeat till you kill Kazeros.</p>

<p align=justify>A few things worth mentioning: multiple patterns in this phase inflicts the debuff that makes you eplode after a few seconds (red fog from 'Imprison' mech and a few other patterns) and one that reduces your healing received (this one stacks up to 5 times and then transforms into 100% reduced healing received - this one is not cleansable and lasts for ~2 minutes).</p>

## <ins>Transition</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 

<p align=justify>After you finish the last clash in phase 2 Kazeros will activate a cutscene and transition into another arena. He lands in a middle and sends 3 waves of blue lines. On the 3rd wave he also spawns puddles under all players. After that he will spawn 4 cones and an additional red line under each player. This is also a timing for bonus clash which can be taken by the closest player standing right in front of him (Kazeros targets one random players and constantly rotates towards him). Its not a mandatory to take that one, but it is an additional damage opening. After that he ascends and lands creating an explosion which instakill the players.</p>

</video>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>

<p align=justify>Overall its a fairly safe pattern to dps if you keep your distance from the others. Support should use awakening on it in case of somebody getting hit by the line.</p>
<p align=justify>You should also spread around a bit to not overlap the puddles as well as the last red line. It can be deadly with too many of them stacked up and also its easier for a person to take the clash - less overlaps means less damage. Support should also DR that person so he dont have to worry about taking any damage while taking the clash.</p>

## <ins>Tile mech</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 

<p align=justify>After that Kazeros transform arena into a 6x6 square and players split into x3/x3+1 positions. One random player will be targeted by a <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> while the others will destroy a few tiles around them. After the succesful <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> Kazeros will land on top of that player and do a <code style="color : Fuchsia">co-op counter</code>. If you fail <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> Kazeros will repeat the pattern until you succeed it, ultimately leaving you with no space to resolve the mech if you fail it repeatedly.</p>

<p align=justify>After that he will vanish and dash 2 times towards the random players performing a <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code>.</p>

</video>

<p align=justify>If somebody fails then he will instead drop on top of that person and require a <code style="color : Blue">counter</code> after he lands. If you do not <code style="color : Blue">counter</code> him that person dies (everyone that got caught).</p>

</video>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>

<p align=justify>The timing for guard is just slightly after you see him on your screen.</p>
<p align=justify>You should wait a moment before moving out after the <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> (if you are not the one doing it). Reason for that is you normally destroy only 2 tiles next to each other starting from your position, but if you are standing right on top of 3 (crossing line with 2 + 1 next to them) you will destroy all of them (same goes for higher amount of tiles). This way you can block off your teammates or just destroy tiles closer to the middle.</p>
<p align=justify>A few tips for identifying if you are the one who has to <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code>: If your camera zooms in its either you or somebody next to you; If the lines are overlapping try to find the one that ends right behind you - it will be the true direction; <code style="color : Darkorange">Guard</code> towards the opposite side of the arrows (like in Mordum g1 at the last phase - arrows indicates direction from which boss will come)</p>
<p align=justify>Use any skill with at least para immunity (havent tested, might be only push, but try it out) if you are not the one being targeted. Reason for that is Kazeros can push you off the map while charging towards another person (clip below).</p>

</video>

<p align=justify>After the successful <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> everyone want to stack middle while the person who <code style="color : Darkorange">guarded</code> will stay close to them, but not enough to drop Kazeros on top of them - this way that person can just dash in and the others will <code style="color : Blue">counter</code>. You also have a lot of time to <code style="color : Blue">counter</code> so dont be too hasty and get hit by the blue line which comes out of him after the landing.</p>
<p align=justify>Right after double <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> you want to use inana to safely get through the next segment. If you fail it and instead will have to <code style="color : Blue">counter</code> him, make sure to cast inana before he drops down so you wont get stunned while trying to <code style="color : Blue">counter</code>.</p>

## <ins>Arena shrink</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 

<p align=justify>Kazeros will shrink arena and use exclusive patterns to this phase. He will use 3 of his normal patterns and then 1 of his special pattern.</p>

<p align=justify>3. Front Back</p>
🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 
<p align=justify>Kazeros does a combination of 3 motions - front hit + back hit + front kick and then he follows it with an 'after-hit'. If anyone gets hit by the 'after-hit' he will follow-up with one of the 'Pole Vault' variations or just a front cleave.</p>

</video>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>
<p align=justify>Prioritize dodging his last 'after-hit' so you wont have to deal with any additional follow-ups.</p>

<p align=justify>4. Kick</p>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 
<p align=justify>Kazeros does a double front cleave followed by a kick and 'after-hit'. If somebody gets hit by the last one then he will follow-up with one of the 'Pole Vault' variations or just a front cleave.</p>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>
<p align=justify>Prioritize dodging his last 'after-hit' so you wont have to deal with any additional follow-ups.</p>
<p align=justify>One small thing - these patterns can push you off the map, especially 'after-hits' so beware of that.</p>

## <ins>Twin swords - specials</ins>

<p align=justify>1.Co-op counter</p>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 
<p align=justify>Kazeros will do a double 'Pole vault' pattern in one place - he will do it 2 times and each time there will be 2 overlaps (think of it as 2x2) followed by a <code style="color : Fuchsia">co-op counter</code>. After that he will explode 2 times with inside safe every time and finish with a dash spin towards the players.<p>

</video>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>
<p align=justify>You want to make sure to avoid getting hit by any explosions, because they inflict the red fog debuff (the one which makes you explode after 9 seconds).</p>
<p align=justify>Before the dash spin you also want to stay stacked together and in front of the boss to avoid getting pushed out of the map. Supports should DR this one.</p>

<p align=justify>2.Guard</p>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 
<p align=justify>Kazeros will start with a backflip into a 'Pole vault'. He will then spin his sword around him 3 times and then explode outside with inside being safe. He will then repeat the sword spin and then throw his sword in front of him which will do a 360 spin with an inside being safe. After he retracts his sword he will do another explosion - this time around him with outside being safe. Then he will finish with a double <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> towards the players.</p>

</video>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>
<p align=justify>Before he throws out his sword make sure to stay stacked in front - it targets one player.</p>
<p align=justify>Last double <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> is hard to execute so people can just stay together in front of Kazeros with supports DR so he doesnt push you off the map.</p>

## <ins>Guard pizza</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 
<p align=justify>After resolving the special pattern Kazeros will throw his sword towards the middle and start sending waves of red cones, which are delayed explosions, coming out of him 4 times. During the 3rd one he will also do a <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> coming out of his sword. </p>

</video>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>
<p align=justify>To <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> you have to aim towards his sword.</p>
<p align=justify>You can also just timestop this pattern, because its an extremely dangerous one. It can push you off the map, but also just kill you with the amount of damage it deals.</p>

## <ins>Rectangle arena</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 
<p align=justify>After that he will dash forward and destroy large chunk of arena behind him. Then he will do a backstep and jump towards towards the part which he destroyed, with the safespot being right in front of it, sending all of the players flying. After that players will have to clik 'A' to get down and position themselves in a way to avoid his attack, which is a line going through him.</p>

    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-1%20Clips/G2-1_Rectangle_Arena_Transition.mp4">
</video>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>
<p align=justify>Make sure to instantly reposition from his back. His attack that destroy chunk of the arena also pushes anyone getting caught by it making it easy to fall off.</p>
<p align=justify>His line, that goes through him, is always based on his front/back positioning. You have to dodge to his side, but dont spacebar instantly. Wait a moment and then dash out - if you do it too fast he can slightly rotate which will change the direction of line.</p>

## <ins>DPS check</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 
<p align=justify>At this point boss recovers parts of the arena and gets an additional bar under his health. You have to deal enough dmg during 1 minute to make it dissapear. During this phase boss uses all of his normal patterns from phase 1 as well as special patterns from >75% meter after 2-3 normal patterns, but enough time to only use one of those.</p>
<p align=justify>Check 'G2-1/Phase 1/Special patterns' for all of them.</p>

<p align=justify>If you fail the dps check boss will gain X amount of stacks which increase his damage based on the % of the bar left. Its not a wipe.</p>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>
<p align=justify>Play around the parts that are not destroyed. Its extremely easy to get pushed off the map during this phase. Control the aggro.</p>

## <ins>DPS Check 2</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 
<p align=justify>Final mech of this phase. Boss will return to the 'Tiled arena'. Then he will send 3 waves of red cones followed by a <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> after. At the same time, right after the 2nd wave, he will spawn 3 small cones with a bit different color attached to him. By standing inside of them you can fill them up making them dissapear after dealing enough damage. If you move out of them at any point the dmg you dealt to them will restart making you have to start from 0 (as long as at least 1 player is inside it wont restart). If you do not manage to destroy them in time its a wipe.</p>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>
<p align=justify>You should dodge the first 2 cones and then move inside them and use Hypers.</p>
<p align=justify>You want to split into 3 groups of 2 to guarantee even dmg distribution.</p>

## <ins>Repeat</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 
<p align=justify>If you did not manage to clear it by now Kazeros will repeat everything starting from the 'Tile mech'.</p>
<p align=justify>The only thing that changes is there wont be a double <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> right after it with people stacking together. Kazeros will instead spin his sword around him 3 times and then do an explosion which is inside safe on top of Kazeros.</p>
