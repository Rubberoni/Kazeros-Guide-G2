# <ins>Patterns</ins>

<p align=justify>Phase 3, just like phase 2, is a sequence of patterns that repeat till you kill Kazeros.</p>

<p align=justify>A few things worth mentioning: multiple patterns in this phase inflicts the debuff that makes you eplode after a few seconds (red fog from 'Imprison' mech and a few other patterns) and one that reduces your healing received (this one stacks up to 5 times and then transforms into 100% reduced healing received - this one is not cleansable and lasts for ~2 minutes).</p>

## <ins>Transition</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 

<p align=justify>After you finish the last clash in phase 2 Kazeros will activate a cutscene and transition into another arena. He lands in a middle and sends 3 waves of blue lines. On the 3rd wave he also spawns puddles under all players. After that he will spawn 4 cones and additional red line under each player. This is also a timing for bonus clash which can be taken by the closest player. Its not a mandatory to take that one, but it is an additional damage opening. After that he ascends and lands creating an explosion which instakill the players.</p>

<i><p align=center>Bit after the cones he will inititate a clash animation. If you want to enter it you have to be right in front of him during the red line + cone explosion (DPS + 1 support who will DR him)</i></p>

## <ins>Tile mech</ins>

<p align=justify>After that Kazeros transform arena into a 6x6 square and players split into x3/x3+1 positions. One random player will be targeted by a <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> while others will destroy 2 tiles around them. After the succesful <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> Kazeros will land on top of that player and do a <code style="color : Fuchsia">co-op counter</code>.</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>If you fail <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> Kazeros will repeat the pattern ultimately leaving you with no space to resolve the mech if you fail it repeatedly.    
It is advised to gather middle and the person who was targeted should be close, but not close enough to overlap Kazeros explosion with the other players.  
The trick to know if you are the one being targeted is by seeing if camera zoomed in. If it did that means its either you or the person close to you.  
If you are not the one being targeted you want to use any skill with at least para immunity. Sometimes Kazeros might hit you by targeting person close to you which might push you off the map.</i></p>

<p align=justify>After that he will vanish and dash 2 times towards the random players performing a <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code>.</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>You want to stack together on that one and <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> towards the Kazeros.  
If somebody fails then he will instead drop on top of that person and require a <code style="color : Blue">counter</code> after he lands. If you do not <code style="color : Blue">counter</code> him that person dies.</i></p>

## <ins>Twin swords</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros will shrink arena and use exclusive patterns to this phase.</p>

<p align=justify>1.1 Pole vault - no inside safe</p>

<p align=justify>3. Front Back</p>

<p align=justify>4. Kick</p>

    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-1%20Clips/G2-1_Kick_Combo.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>Important info: Both 3rd and 4th patterns have follow-ups if you get hit by their final attack.  
Both of those have after-kick which initiates follow-up in case somebody gets hit by it.</i></p>

<i><p align=center>3rd pattern should have ended after front kick, but because somebody got hit by it Kazeros did 'Pole vault - inside safe' follow-up.  
4th pattern should have ended after front kick, but because somebody got hit by it Kazeros did additional front cleave.</i></p>

<i><p align=center>Both of those follow-ups can happen in both of these patterns. That means he could've done 'Pole vault' follow-up after 4th patern and front cleave after 3rd pattern. Its important to be wary of that.</i></p>

## <ins>Twin swords - specials</ins>

<p align=justify>After Kazeros performs 3 of these patterns he will use one of his 2 Special Patterns exclusive to this phase.</p>

<p align=justify>1.Co-op counter</p>

<p align=justify>Kazeros will do double 'Pole vault' pattern in one place followed by a <code style="color : Fuchsia">co-op counter</code>. After that he will explode 2 times with inside safe every time and finish with dash spin towards the players.<p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>It is advised to just tank the last spin close to middle of the arena so he doesnt knock you off the map.</i></p>

<p align=justify>2.Guard</p>

<p align=justify>Kazeros will start with a backflip into 'Pole vault'. He will then spin around him and explode outside with inside safe. He will then throw his spear which is also inside safe and do an inside explosion this time with outside being safe. After that he will finish with a <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code>.</p>

</video>

## <ins>Guard Pizza</ins>

<p align=justify>After resolving the special pattern Kazeros will throw his spear towards one side and start spawning rotating pizza cones coming out of him 4 times. During the 3rd one he will also do a <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> coming out of his spear. </p>

</video>

## <ins>Rectangle arena</ins>

<p align=justify>After that he will dash forward and destroy large chunk of arena behind him. Then he will do a backstep and jump towards towards the part which he destroyed, with the safespot being right in front of it, sending all of the players flying. After that players will have to do QTE (button A) and position themselves in a way to avoid his attack, which is a line going through him.</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>Make sure to quickly move out from the parts of the arena he destroys to not fall off the map.  
Quickly identify safepot during the QTE by checking where the boss is facing and dash toward the side.</i></p>

## <ins>DPS check</ins>

<p align=justify>At this point boss recovers parts of the arena and gets additional bar under his health. You have to deal enough dmg during 1 minute to make it dissapear. During this phase boss uses all his normal patterns from phase 1 as well as special patterns from >75% meter every 2-3 normal patterns (enough time for only 1).</p>

<i><p align=center>If you fail the dps check boss will gain X amount of stacks which increase his damage based on the % of the bar left.</i></p>

</video>

## <ins>DPS check 2</ins>

<p align=justify>Final mech of this phase. Boss will return to the 'Tiled arena' and 3 small cones coming out of him will appear. By standing inside of them you can fill them up making them dissapear after dealing enough damage.</p>

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-1%20Clips/G2-1_Last_DPS_Check.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>You want to split into 3 groups of 2 to quickly get rid of them. You should have Hyper awakening saved for that mech (you can also use kadan to destroy one of the cones).  
You cant move out of them otherwise the bar will reset.  
Not getting rid of them will result in raid wipe.</i></p>

<p align=justify>If you do not manage to finish this gate by now this whole phase will repeat.</p>
