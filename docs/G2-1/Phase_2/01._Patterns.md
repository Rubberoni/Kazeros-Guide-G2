# <ins>Patterns</ins>

<p align=justify>Because phase 2 doesnt really have specific patterns to it, but rather a specific order of patterns/mechs, this section will explain what happens right after each other.</p>

## <ins>Transition</ins>

<p align=justify>After resolving the Blackhole Kazeros transitions into broken arena phase.</p>

## <ins>Stagger</ins>

<p align=justify>Then he requires a stagger while constantly throwing boulders which cover large parts of the arena.</p>

</video>

## <ins>Rock</ins>

<p align=justify>Then he targets one players and follows him around. Its a dps check which if failed instantly kills that person. Otherwise he spawns rock which he throws towards that person (DR it)</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>If you have problems with it you can keep sidereal for that.  
The cones that he spawns on sides makes him omnidirectional there.  
No clip, but right after he covers arena with more rocks - just go top.</i></p>

## <ins>Transition 2</ins>

<p align=justify>He blocks off sides of the arena and dashes in a line spreading around red lines which explodes after a moment while the dash itself deals damage instantly. After that he lands while spawning lines and then dashes towards one of the wall while exploding the other side.</p>

</video>

## <ins>Stagger</ins>

<p align=justify>He dashes bottom and does a heavy stagger which results in a raid wipe if failed. This happens 2 times with the 2nd one also spawning puddles. After that he performs a clash.</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>The less stagger you have the more deadly puddles you will see. Order is:  
Puddle under -> Donut -> Puddle under + Donut (check below)</i></p>

</video>

## <ins>Clash</ins>

<p align=justify>This clip is from the other side, but would work exactly the same.</p>

<p align=justify>After the clash he dashes towards wall again and targets one person (eye above the head). That person needs to aim his attack towards the rock (its the objective of this phase, to destroy it). After that he spawns rain around him which you just shield/DR.</p>

    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-1%20Clips/G2-1_Clash_Post-Stagger.mp4">
</video>

<p align=justify>This part repeats 2 times.</p>

<p align=justify>Stagger -> Clash -> Stagger -> Clash</p>

<i><p align=center>One more thing: beware of random wall. Not sure what procs it, but he can do that pattern in this phase.</i></p>

</video>

## <ins>Chains</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros dashes middle and creates star shape explosion around him which stuns you. After that he spawns a lot or puddles around him which you need to take in order to avoid raid wide. After that you need to click coresponding button (should be always A) to avoid damage from chains and then dash middle to not get hit by lines around.</p>

    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-1%20Clips/G2-1_Chains_QTE.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>The quicker you get hit by the puddle the less time you will have to react to QTE so you want to prolong geting hit by a bit.  
You want to hit QTE the moment background cleans up from all the clutter.</i></p>

## <ins>Last Clash</ins>

<p align=justify>1 person clashes with Kazeros and then gets silenced after.</p>

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">

</video>

<p align=justify>After that you will need to split into 2 groups who will alternate with <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> excluding the person who is silenced. Each group will stand middle and perform guard towards where Kazeros lands. You can only do it one time because of the silence. After every <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> you will have to QTE to get back on the ground.</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>You split into groups to minimize failure risk.</i></p>


<p align=justify>After this you transition into phase 3.</p>
