# <ins>Patterns</ins>

<p align=justify>Because phase 2 doesnt really have specific patterns to it, but rather a specific order of patterns/mechs, this section will explain everything that happens in an order.</p>

## <ins>Transition</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 

<p align=justify>After resolving the 'Blackhole' mech Kazeros will split the arena in half destroying the top part, killing any players who were standing on it the moment it gets destroyed. Then he will drop down in the middle part of the leftover half, spawn blue lines around and dash towards one player.</p>

</video>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>

<p align=justify>You want to stack together on top to get shields from the supports and make it easier to start DPSing him.</p>

## <ins>Stagger</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 

<p align=justify>He will then reposition and begin a stagger check. During it he will periodicaly throw boulders from top of the map towards the bottom which can instakill players. After the first wave (3 boulders) he will also spawn rocks around him which activate after a moment and fly towards the kazeros dealing small amount of damage to any players on the way. If you fail the stagger its a raid wipe.</p>

</video>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>

<p align=justify>I like to use Hyper Awaken as a support on this pattern (right at the start of the stagger). Sometimes people are greeding a bit too much with a stagger and this will save them from dying.</p>

## <ins>Rock</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 

<p align=justify>After the stagger all of the small rocks will fly towards Kazeros exploding on top of him, dealing a lot of damage and knocking down any players hit by them. Then Kazeros targets one person and 2 red cones spawns on both sides of him making him omnidirectional. Its a DPS check which requires you to deal enough inside these cones.</p>
<p align=justify>Players should stack either on 3 or 9 (based on where you finish after the boulders) and a leader wants to go 6 and use sidereal. Reason for that is you want sidereal to hit from the cone side to make a DPS check easier (or in case of the hard mode instantly break it). If its still alive (or the sidereal missed), players who are not being targeted by the Kazeros should move inside the cones and finish the DPS check.</p>  

<p align=justify>If you succeed the DPS check then Kazeros will stop following that player and lock in place. Everyone should get behind him (not sides, there is still a hitbox) to avoid the rock that will fly towards Kazeros from his front. Then he targets one player again with the same rock, which this time is just some damage which supports should DR/shield.</p>

    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-1%20Clips/G2-1_Rock_Check.mp4">
</video>

<p align=justify>If you fail the DPS check it just kills the person who is being targeted (with everyone in front) with everything else being the same.</p>
<p align=justify>Right after this mech he will dash middle and then towards top. Then he will throw large boulders on the sides of the arena with a safe spot being around/front of him - which is a free DPS pattern before next transition.</p>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>

<p align=justify>Instead of trying to use sidereal to take care of the DPS check you can also precast shandi and recast him in a way that you will have full CD reduction for upcoming DPS check. This will allow you to fully benefit from it as well (in clip above they did that).</p>
<p align=justify>Supports should shield/DR explosions from small rocks, because they can deal a lot of damage when stacked on top of each other.</p>
<p align=justify>Make sure to not rotate the boss during DPS check, otherwise leader might miss the sidereal. Same thing applies when he targets another player - this time to not troll positionals.</p>
<p align=justify>This mech can be survived if failed with Crisis evasion - which is i like using Hyper Awakening from supports on that one. It persists long enough to save people from getting hit from the boulders and also to save them from the failed DPS check.</p>
<p align=justify>If you go top after this mech then you can reach his back even tho he is dashing towards the edge. Its a few more seconds of back attacking if you want to greed. Its completely safe.</p>

## <ins>Transition 2</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 

<p align=justify>He blocks off sides of the arena and dashes in a line spreading around red lines which explodes after a moment while the dash itself deals damage instantly. After that he lands in the middle and spawns blue lines around. Then he dashes either towards left or right wall and destroys the other one while at the same time covering the other side in a blue explosion.</p>

    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-1%20Clips/G2-1_Transition_2.mp4">
</video>

<p align=justify>If anyone gets hit by the blue explosion then he will get immobilised in the air. Kazeros then will require a <code style="color : Fuchsia">co-op counter</code>. If succeeded - person will be freed, if failed - he will push him off the edge.</p>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>
<p align=justify>Everyone should stack together before the dash to make it easier to dodge Kazeros. Supports should also awaken on that to avoid any unnecessary deaths.</p>
<p align=justify>During this whole phase (till 'Chains') he can sometimes do a 'Wall' pattern instead of moving to the next one, so beware of that.</p>

## <ins>Stagger</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 

<p align=justify>He dashes bottom and does a heavy stagger which results in a raid wipe if failed. This happens 2 times with the 2nd one also spawning puddles. After that he performs a clash.</p>

</video>

<p align=justify>The less stagger you have the more deadly puddles you will see. While in hardmode there is only 'inside safe donut' in TFM you have 3 different ones, which always happen in the same order: Outside safe -> Inside safe -> Combination of both (ring between the 2 unsafe zones).</p>

</video>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>

<p align=justify>Its a loooong opening which allows you deal a lof of damage. You should make sure to have close to 100% uptime on buffs and prepare your long cd's.</p>
<p align=justify>In hardmode you can just stack behind if you have lots of back attackers. In TFM i would advise to only do that on the first donut (with outside safe) and the moment you have to spacebar out you go in front to make it easier to stack together on 'inside safe donut'.</p>

## <ins>Clash</ins>

<p align=justify>This clip is from the other side, but it doesnt change how it works.</p>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 

<p align=justify>After the clash he dashes towards the wall again and targets one person (eye above the head). He will then require a <code style="color : Blue">counter</code>, which isnt mandatory, but gives you more time to reposition his aim. That person then needs to aim his attack towards the rock, which will partialy destroy it. After that he spawns rain puddles around him.</p>

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-1%20Clips/G2-1_Clash_Post-Stagger.mp4">
</video>

<p align=justify>This part repeats 2 times, so the whole chain of events will look like this:</p>

<p align=justify>Stagger -> Clash -> Stagger -> Clash</p>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>

<p align=justify>Clash is also another long opening. Overall this whole part is just a trixion dummy which allows you to dish insane amounts of damage.</p>
<p align=justify>During the rain supports MUST DR the party. Sometimes they can massively overlap which deals a lot of damage, or can even kill a player. You should also be careful with positioning on that one - rain requires at least para immunity and it can knock you off the map if you are standing close to the edge.</p>

## <ins>Chains</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 

<p align=justify>Kazeros dashes towards the middle and creates a star shape explosion around him which stuns you. After that he spawns a lot of black whirlwinds around him which you need to step into in order to get to the safety. There will be also blue puddles overlaping with some of them which players will have to avoid - they will stun you for the rest of the mech which will just kill you.</p>
<p align=justify>After that you get immobilized in the air with an option to only click A. A moment later whole arena will get covered in chains which kill you if you do not manage to step into a black whirlwind. Then you have to click 'A' the moment you see that chains disappeared to get down. After that you want to spacebar into the Kazeros, because of the 3 additional blue lines on the outside parts of the map, that you might end up inside them after you get down.</p>

</video>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>

<p align=justify>Guaranteed way to not have to worry about blue puddles is to step into the first black whirlwind that spawns. This way you will always be safe (its sometimes extremely hard to see, because of multiple whirlwinds spawning at almost the same time. Usually i just prefer to walk around and take outside whirlwinds - there are less puddles there).</p>
<p align=justify>If you do not manage to step into any whirlwinds you can also just timestop this mech. The timing for that is the moment you see the red indicator. Make sure to not be close to the wall - he destroys it as well as part of the floor next to it.</p>

## <ins>Last Clash</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 

<p align=justify>1 person will enter clash. In TFM he will gets silenced right after the clash.</p>

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-1%20Clips/G2-1_Last_Clash_P2.mp4">
</video>

<p align=justify>TFM ONLY - After that you will need to split into 2 groups who will alternate with a <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> excluding the person who is silenced. Each group will stand in the middle and perform a <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> towards where the Kazeros lands. He will then land and make everyone fly if at least one person succeeded a <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code>. You can only do it one time because of the silence. After every <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> you will have to spam 'A' to get back on the ground. He will do it 2 times.</p>

<p align=justify>In hard no one is silenced so you can just <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> together.</p>

</video>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>

<p align=justify>You cant <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> together if you are silenced. To minimize the risk of failure you split into 2 groups.</p>
