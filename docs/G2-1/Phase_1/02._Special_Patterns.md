# <ins>Special Patterns</ins>

<p align=justify>This section explains patterns that happens at the specific %'s of Kazeros's meter.</p>

<p align=justify>Some info:</p>

* All TFM parties were restarting every single time they saw a Special Pattern before reaching first mech
* Reason for that was, if Kazeros used one of those then he will always queue into another one right after, because of the length of it
* That meant the party was bound to see full meter which resulted in 90% guaranteed restart because of its difficulty
* I will explain all of them below anyway in case you lack damage to burst quickly to the first mech (which on TFM is around ~600m DPS during the first minute)

## <ins>25%</ins>

<i><p align=center>Kazeros imprisons players within the walls and charges towards targeted player 4 times followed by one additional charge which destroys the wall behind him.  
After the wall gets destroyed you need to quickly get out before the final explosion happens.</i></p>

<p align=justify>2. Stonehedge</p>

<i><p align=center>Tons of explosions happen from diferent sources:</i></p>

<i><p align=center>In/out donuts from each player  
Small pizza cones from the pillars  
Lines around the map  
Large pizza cones from the Kazeros</i></p>

<i><p align=center>You have to dodge every single explosion and hide behind the pillar to avoid final one coming from the Kazeros.  
If you get git by a single one you will be immobilized and dragged towards one of the pillars destroying it.</i></p>
