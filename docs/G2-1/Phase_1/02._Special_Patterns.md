# <ins>Special Patterns</ins>

<p align=justify>This section explains patterns that happens at the specific %'s of Kazeros's meter.</p>

<p align=justify>Some info:</p>

* All TFM parties were restarting every single time they saw a Special Pattern before reaching first mech
* Reason for that was, if Kazeros used one of those then he will always queue into another one right after, because of the length of it
* That meant the party was bound to see full meter which resulted in 90% guaranteed restart because of its difficulty
* I will explain all of them below anyway in case you lack damage to burst quickly to the first mech (which on TFM is around ~600m DPS during the first minute)

## <ins>25%</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 

<p align=justify>When Kazeros meter reaches 25% he can do one of the 2 patterns.</p>

<p align=justify>1. Jarvan</p>

<p align=justify>Kazeros dashes to the middle of the arena. After that he jumps on 1 player, creates walls around him and spawns 6 blue lines which stun people and explode later. He then dashes 4 times, each time changing the target. After the 4th dash he will then change target one more time and send a shockwave that destroys part of the wall. He then does an AOE around him that stuns players followed by raid wide explosion coming from him that kills aynone that did not hide behind the wall.</p>

<p align=justify>2. Stonehenge</p>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 
<p align=justify>Kazeros dashes to the middle of the arena. After that he sends 6 blue cones which immobilize players for the rest of the mech if hit while also creating 6 rocks around him. After that 4 cones come out of each rock which also imprison people followed by donuts around the players with either in or out safe, lines around the map and finally 4 more blue cones coming from the boss. After that you have to hide behind any rock.</p>

</video>

<p align=justify>If somebody gets hit by any of the blue patterns he will be immobilized for the whole mech and thrown at the end of it towards the closest rock dealing 2 instances of damage to him - the moment he hits the rock as well as an explosion coming from the rock which destroys it. That also reduces amount of the safespots you can hide from the final explosion.</p>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>

<p align=justify>On the Jarvan you need to be quick with getting out after he destroys the wall. You dont have that much time so be ready to spacebar out.</p>
<p align=justify>Make sure to spread around on the Stonehenge to not overlap with other people and their donuts.</p>

## <ins>50%</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 

<p align=justify>At 50% Kazeros has only 1 available pattern. He dashes to the middle of the arena and forcefuly brings all of the players to him. After that he will perform triple <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> towards the bottom with a different timing on the third one. It goes by 'Slow -> Slow -> Fast'.</p>

</video>

<p align=justify>Anyone can do that, but 1 person will be forced to do it. That person will get the whole map covered in a red fog after a moment except for the safe spot in front of the Kazeros. He wont be able to get away from the hitbox.</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>If you fail at least 2 times you will get stunned (unless you die) and he will perform an additional pattern after - he targets one person and dashes through him followed by 4 red cones. If you get hit by his red cones you will only take some damage, but if you get hit by the Kazeros's dash he will stun you and instakill you without a support DR.</i></p>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>
<p align=justify>Its a long DPS window so the person <code style="color : Darkorange">guarding</code> should focus on getting them right.</p>

## <ins>75%</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 

<p align=justify>Kazeros doesnt exacly have a trigger that happens at 75%. What happens when he reaches 75% is that he will do one of his 'unique patterns', usually after a few normal ones. He has 4 of those and they all are quite deadly. Its useful to learn how to play them, because even if you skip all special patterns, these 4 will be added to his 'pattern pool' on the last phase of gate 2-1.</p>

<p align=justify>1. Co-Op</p>

<p align=justify>Kazeros targets 1 person. He then crouches and does a 360 spin, followed by a jump and drop towards that person with a small explosion around him. After that he does a long range 360 <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> around and finishes it with a <code style="color : Fuchsia">co-op counter</code>. If you fail the <code style="color : Fuchsia">co-op counter</code> then he will do a one more 360 spin with an inside safe and grab the person in front of him and slam with him.</p>

</video>

<p align=justify>2. X</p>

<p align=justify>Kazeros slides around 2 times with a 2nd one being towards one person. After that he slams the ground and creates an X shape explosion from his sides. Then he follows-up with an uppercut in front of him and a slam. After that he requires a co-op counter, which if failed he dashes forward and slams the ground, which creates an expanding explosions, which inflict the debuff making you explode around you after 9 seconds.</p>

<p align=justify>3. Rain</p>

<p align=justify>Kazeros's hands start to glow red and he lifts them up. After a moment he spawns 3 waves of puddles around him raining from the sky. They slowly expand outside with every wave. At the end he does a slam which stuns every player in a radius. If somebody gets stunned Kazeros will dash behind him and do a series of punches dealing heavy damage. If multiple people gets stunned he will choose one person between them. After that, if the person is still alive, he will then do a <code style="color : Fuchsia">co-op counter</code>, which if not done will just kill the player. If you succeed if then he will target you and you have to bait his hit from others.</p>

<p align=justify>4. Double guard</p>

<p align=justify>Kazeros does double guard - first with his right hand and then his left hand.</p>

</video>

<p align=justify>If everyone misses it then he does a 360 spin.</p>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>

<p align=justify>These patterns are slightly changed in hard mode. Rain shows stun indicator, X is only a normal counter, co-op not sure about it, because i havent experienced that one.</p>
<p align=justify>While the co-op and X are pretty straightfoward in terms of dealing with them, on rain the safest solution would be to dash towards Kazeros after the 2nd wave and use splendid sacred bomb. You can spacebar the stun/GT it (this one i leave to you to test out, im just an artist player).</p>

## <ins>100%</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 

<p align=justify>Personally i would advise skipping it if you can, but if you really want to see why everyone in TFM was insantly restarting the gate if they did not manage to skip, here you go.</p>

<p align=justify>Full meter pattern is, would say, the most unforgiving, requiring the most coordination pattern out of the whole raid. Its a combination of 3 overlapping attacks that immobilize you for the remainder of the duration and also 1 attack that instakills you (which pretty much always happens when you get immobilized). Each player gets orb that follows him around which instakills him. Multiples lines spawn around the map that stuns the players + AOE explosions spawn on the outside parts of the map also stunning the players + Kazeros slams a ground that sends a shockwave after a brief moment, that requires you to stop moving and look away otherwise you gets stunned.</p>

<p align=justify>Below you can see how the mech looks like.</p>

[Impossible Mech](https://www.youtube.com/live/IklPwHmJLZc?si=_QnDz2t8Ny_wxrnJ&t=1516)

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>
<p align=justify>On hard mode there are only 2 orbs chasing the same people around and you only have to look away from the Kazeros. You also get a relic book from the achievement if you survive this mech with all 8 people alive. Overall would say that this mech is fairly simple compared to TFM. Its still might be hard to execute for some people.</p>
