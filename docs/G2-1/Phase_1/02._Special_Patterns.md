# <ins>Special Patterns</ins>

<p align=justify>This section explains patterns that happens at the specific %'s of Kazeros's meter.</p>

<p align=justify>Some info:</p>

* All TFM parties were restarting every single time they saw a Special Pattern before reaching first mech
* Reason for that was, if Kazeros used one of those then he will always queue into another one right after, because of the length of it
* That meant the party was bound to see full meter which resulted in 90% guaranteed restart because of its difficulty
* I will explain all of them below anyway in case you lack damage to burst quickly to the first mech (which on TFM is around ~600m DPS during the first minute)
