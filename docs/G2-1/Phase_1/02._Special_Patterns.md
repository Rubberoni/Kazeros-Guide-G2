# <ins>Special Patterns</ins>

<p align=justify>This section explains patterns that happens at the specific %'s of Kazeros's meter.</p>

<p align=justify>Some info:</p>

* All TFM parties were restarting every single time they saw a Special Pattern before reaching first mech
* Reason for that was, if Kazeros used one of those then he will always queue into another one right after, because of the length of it
* That meant the party was bound to see full meter which resulted in 90% guaranteed restart because of its difficulty
* I will explain all of them below anyway in case you lack damage to burst quickly to the first mech (which on TFM is around ~600m DPS during the first minute)

## <ins>25%</ins>

<p align=justify>When Kazeros meter reaches 25% he can do one of the 2 patterns.</p>

<p align=justify>1. Jarvan</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>Kazeros imprisons players within the walls and charges towards targeted player 4 times followed by one additional charge which destroys the wall behind him.  
After the wall gets destroyed you need to quickly get out before the final explosion happens.</i></p>

<p align=justify>2. Stonehenge</p>

<i><p align=center>Tons of explosions happen from diferent sources:</i></p>

<i><p align=center>In/out donuts from each player  
Small pizza cones from the pillars  
Lines around the map  
Large pizza cones from the Kazeros</i></p>

<i><p align=center>You have to dodge every single explosion and hide behind the pillar to avoid final one coming from the Kazeros.  
If you get git by a single one you will be immobilized and dragged towards one of the pillars destroying it.</i></p>

## <ins>50%</ins>

<p align=justify>At 50% Kazeros has only 1 available pattern. If you did not manage to skip to the 1st mech he will queue into this one after one of his 25% patterns.</p>

<p align=justify>1. Triple Guard</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>Kazeros pulls everyone towards middle and chooses one person to do a triple <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code>.  
Everyone can <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code>, but that sole person can not escape, which means he will get killed if he ignores it.  
Perspective from the imprisoned person:</i></p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>If you fail at least 2 times you will get stunned (unless you die) and he will perform a follow-up targeting that person.</i></p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>If somebody gets hit by a cone or Kazeros, he will get stunned and most likely die from his follow-up.</i></p>

## <ins>75%</ins>

<p align=justify>This one is a bit tricky. Kazeros doesnt exacly have a trigger that happens at 75%.
    
What happens when he reaches 75% is that he will do one of his 'unique patterns' after a few normal patterns (havent counted, think after 2-3). He has 3 of those.</p>

<p align=justify>1. Co-Op</p>

<p align=justify>2. X</p>

<p align=justify>3. Rain</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>This one is a bit tricky. At the end of the rain you get stunned by the shockwave and people need to perform co-op counter to save you.  
Easiest way to avoid it is by stacking on top of the boss after the 3rd rain and throwing Splendid sacred bomb to avoid getting stunned (GT works).  
Rain is expanding outside in waves, which means on the 3rd one inside will be safe.</i></p>

## <ins>100%</ins>

<p align=justify>Personally i would advise skipping it if you can, but if you really want to see why everyone in TFM was insantly restarting the gate if they did not manage to skip, here you go.</p>

<p align=justify>Full meter pattern is, would say, the most unforgiving, requiring the most coordination pattern out of the whole raid. Its a combination of 3 overlapping attacks that immobilize you for the remainder of the duration and also 1 attack that instakills you (which pretty much always happens when you get immobilized).</p>
