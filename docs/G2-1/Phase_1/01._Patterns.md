# <ins>Normal Patterns</ins>

<p align=justify>This sections explains normal patterns that Kazeros uses during phase 1 till the broken arena.</p>
<p align=justify>You will also see that some patterns will have something that i call 'after-hit'. What i mean by that is Kazeros on some patterns will follow-up his hits with a burst of air that deals damage and also pushes you (which can be ignored with at least para immunity).</p>

</video>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>

<p align=justify>He always starts this gate with a 'Front wall' pattern.</p>
<p align=justify>If you get hit by it you will get imprisoned and others will have to free you.</p>

## <ins>Jump Guard</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong> 
<p align=justify>Kazeros kneels and a red aura surrounds him. After a moment he jumps, creating an explosion around him, and dashes towards one player after he lands. Then he performs a <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> towards him followed by a cleave. This pattern has 2 variations based on if anyone got hit by the cleave.</p>

<p align=justify>1. Jump guard into back wall</p>

<p align=justify>If anyone got hit by the cleave he will then spawn a wall behind him.</p>

</video>

<p align=justify>2. Jump guard into front wall</p>

<p align=justify>If no one got hit by the cleave he will then do a backdash and spawn a wall in front of him.</p>

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-1%20Clips/G2-1_Jump_Guard_Front_Wall.mp4">
</video>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>

<p align=justify>He doesnt deal damage when he lands.</p>
<p align=justify><code style="color : Darkorange">Guard</code> is a ~180 angle on his right side which means you can ignore it completely on his left side. Cleave is a ~270 angle covering both of his sides + front which means back is safe.</p>
<p align=justify>You can also completely ignore this <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> using any skill with at least para immunity, because it doesnt affect his cleave and neither the wall. Wall spawn is always based on somebody getting hit by the cleave.</p>
<p align=justify>If you have lots of back attackers this pattern is a nice DPS window for them if nobody gets hit by the wall. If somebody does get hit by it make sure to call out/ping so the other can expect 'Back wall'.</p>

## <ins>Slow kick</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong>

<p align=justify>Kazeros takes a step back and kicks one person which he later follows-up with a punch behind his back into an 'after-hit' and finishes off with a front punch into an 'after-hit'.</p>

    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-1%20Clips/G2-1_Slow_Kick.mp4">
</video>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>

<p align=justify>All of the hits require only para immunity.</p>
<p align=justify>His 'after-hit' behind his back is a bit different compered to the others. This one instead of pushing you away from him will pull you towards his front.</p>
<p align=justify>His front punch knocks people up. If you are right in front of him during that he will the grab you, but if you are not close enough he will just push you away from him with his 'after-hit'.</p>

## <ins>Scratches</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong>

<p align=justify>Kazeros targets one person and then perform a combo (5) of punches + kicks with a few (2) 'after-hits' between them.</p>

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-1%20Clips/G2-1_Scratches.mp4">
</video>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>
<p align=justify>This isnt a particularly dangerous pattern. You need skills with at least para immunity to get away from it, but if you do get caught off guard then you wont have time to move aside mid-combo. Supports should watch out for any people getting stuck in Kazeros's flurry of hits.</p>

## <ins>Right/Left</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong>

<p align=justify>Kazeros does 2 cleaves with a different hands and then follows-up with an uppercut. AFter that he rotates and does a ~240 angle cleave in front of him. This pattern has 2 variations with an only difference between them being a hand that he starts the pattern with.</p>

<p align=justify>1. Left -> Right</p>

<p align=justify>He cleaves with his left hand and then right. Then he follows-up with a left hand uppercut.</p>

</video>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>
<p align=justify>His first 2 cleaves require only para immunity while his uppercut requires a push immunity.</p>
<p align=justify>His uppercut is a straight line hitbox on one of his side, which means you can safely stay on the other side to avoid it.</p>
<p align=justify>His last cleave has also a safespot right in front of the boss which can be useful for front attackers or if you cant make it behind him.</p>

</video>

    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-1%20Clips/G2-1_Guard_Spin_Fail.mp4">
</video>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>
<p align=justify>All of his hits on a successful <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> require only para immunity.</p>
<p align=justify>If you are standing right in front of him during the final 'after-hit' he will then grab you and slam with you.</p>
<p align=justify>Because of its full angle you have to <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> if you are close to him</p>

## <ins>Double Guard</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong>

<p align=justify>Kazeros targets one person and dashes through him. Then he cleaves him and does a <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> followed by another one behind him.</p>

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-1%20Clips/G2-1_Double_Guard.mp4">
</video>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>
<p align=justify>Initial dash doesnt do anything - its only for Kazeros to reach the player.</p>
<p align=justify>His <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> is a ~140 angle which means if you are close to his side you wont have to <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code>. You also have to <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> only one time, unless the person Kazeros was targeting moved too far away from him just before the <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code>. The reason for that is Kazeros is dashing with his <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code>, so he can accidentaly end up behind you, which forces you to perform 2 <code style="color : Darkorange">guards</code> instead of 1. Thats why its important to not run away from him during this pattern.</p>
<p align=justify>His initial cleave requires only para immune. You can also just ignore the <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> by using any skills with push immune which is a good way to greed with shields from supports.</p>

## <ins>Triple Jump</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong>

<p align=justify>Kazeros jumps in place, targets one person and then slides towards him dealing damage in front. After that he does an uppercut behind followed by an 'after-hit' and slams down, dealing damage around and creating blue lines which stun people after a moment and explode a bit later. Then he does an uppercut behind him again, also followed by an 'after-hit' and finishes this time with an explosion where he lands followed by an explosion outside.</p>

    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-1%20Clips/G2-1_Triple_Jump.mp4">
</video>

✅<strong>Useful information</strong>
<p align=justify>He always follows one person, which means he can also change direction between the jumps.</p>
<p align=justify>You can partially greed on his back, because there is no hitbox till he does an uppercut.</p>
<p align=justify>In hardmode there is no explosion on top of him on his last landing, so you can stick to his back. There is only an explosion around. </p>

## <ins>Waves</ins>

🗒️<strong>Explanation</strong>

<p align=justify>Kazeros does a backflip and targets 1 player. After a moment he sends multiple waves of slashes towards that person followed by one final wave in X's shape.</p>

</video>

<p align=justify>You can hide behind him the moment he locks onto you. He wont rotate till his final hit.</p>
<p align=justify>This pattern deals a lof of damage so should try to quickly identify it and hide behind him. On his final wave he rotates towards the targeted person again.
