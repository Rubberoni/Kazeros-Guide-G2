# <ins>Mechs</ins>

<p align=justify>This section explains all the mechs that happens in phase 1.</p>

## <ins>Prokel (700x)</ins>

<p align=justify>When you reach 700x every player gets to fight with his copy of Kazeros. It's a stagger check that requires you to pass it to prevent wipe. Stagger bar is shared across every clone which makes it a team effort. You have 1 minute in total to pass the mech.</p>

<p align=justify>During this phase he has new patterns that are similar to his previous phase, but slightly changed. It's important to hit every <code style="color : Blue">counter</code>, because of a stacking debuff on the boss that increases his stagger taken.</p>

### <ins>Counters</ins>

<p align=justify>There are 2 variations of <code style="color : Blue">counter</code>.</p>

<p align=justify>1. He does a small backstep and holds his spear behind him. If you fail it he will stab you</p>

<p align=justify>2. He spins his spear and charges at you. If you fail it he goes through you, rotates 180 and does front cleave</p>

### <ins>Guards</ins>

<p align=justify>There are 3 variations of <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code>.</p>

<p align=justify>1. He does a backstep and throws his spear in front which then returns to him like a boomerang. He then slams the ground and does a rapid explosion.</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>Timing for <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> is ~0.5 after he slams the ground.</i></p>

<p align=justify>2. This one is a variation of 'spin guard'. The only difference is that he vanishes after the first hit and the <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> animation happens a bit faster. There can also be a slight variation to this one which spawns expanding explosions with the safe spot being next to Kazeros so just stay near him at the end.</p>

<p align=justify>3. He spins his spear and holds it behind his back. After a moment he will do a front cleave which is a <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code>.</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>This one is the fastest of the 3. You can spam <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> the moment you see a glow.  
There is also a possibility of him faking 2nd <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> into this one. He starts with a slash, but then doesn't disappear and goes into 3rd <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> animation</i></p>

### <ins>Overlap clone</ins>

<p align=justify>Periodically during the whole mech there will be a clone spawning that only 1 player can see. He will then perform one of the 2 exclusive patterns that before could happen only after Kazeros got 4 stacks of ‘Shield debuff’.</p>

#### <ins>1. Donut</ins>

#### <ins>2. Star</ins>

</video>

<i><p align=center>This time the spawn points of both of them are scripted. Star can only spawn in positions 3, 9 and middle, meanwhile Donut can spawn in positions 2, 5, 7, 9.   
It is advised to play on North/South so you can have better access to safe spots - either to run in or out on Donut and away from Star.  
The sole player that can see clones should also warn out other players of upcoming overlap.</i></p>

### <ins>Other patterns</ins>

<p align=justify>Everything else is a mix of his normal patterns and <code style="color : Purple">special patterns</code> that are modified to be soloable. There are also some new patterns that only exist in this mech.</p>

<p align=justify>1. Variation of 'special co-op that' has no <code style="color : Fuchsia">co-op counter</code>. You have to dodge his instakill pattern which is noticeably faster.</p>

<p align=justify>2. Kazeros charges beam with his left hand and shoots it towards the player.</p>

</video>

<p align=justify>3. Kazeros pulls back his spear and does a whirlwind which knocks you up in the air and follows it with charge. It deals massive amounts of damage and is the 2nd most deadly pattern, right after instakill one.</p>

### <ins>Safe spot</ins>

<p align=justify>After you pass the stagger check Kazeros will spawn cracks moving towards 8 directions. One of those cracks will be shorter than the others. Every player sees a different one being shorter. This will indicate which safe spot is yours.</p>

<i><p align=center>It's important to remember what was your safe spot during this mech. It will be used later on at 500x.  
Koreans are using cardinal positions with +/- (just like in aegir g2). You can also use clockspots, it's fully up to you. With clockspots you would cover every single spot on the clock except for 3/6/9/12.</i></p>
