<p align=justify>This section explains all the mechs that happens in phase 1.</p>

<i><p align=center>Most clashes in this raid are 'random'. That means you can control who enters the clash, by having that person to be the closest to the Kazeros the moment he activates clash pattern.  
I dont remember if all of the clashes are abusable, but will include it if i know it is.</p></i>

## <ins>Fog (900x)</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros teleports middle, and starts sending small clouds of dark fog outside while also spawning puddles under the players.</p>

<i><p align=center>The order of puddles is:  
Below the players -> below the players -> around the players -> around the Kazeros -> below the players -> around the players -> around the Kazeros.  
Overall there isnt one solution to this mech. What is mostly agreed upon is that you split into 2 parties to minimize the risk of getting hit and then bait the puddles to the sides.  
After the puddles around the players explode you use splendid sacred bomb, to prevent getting stunned by the cloud, and dash towards the Kazeros.  
Then you simply alternate between sacred dark bomb usage with DR from the supports to greed with damage.</p></i>

## <ins>Prison</ins>

<p align=justify>The whole mech consists of 4 parts and it activates instantly after the 'Fog' (900x). The main objective is to destroy parts of the walls on the opposite side of each other. Its extremely important that you precisely aim the boss to avoid wiping on this pattern. Because of that it is recommended to aim him towards West and East to easier see where he is facing.</p>

<p align=justify>1. First wall break.</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>Kazeros will surround the players with a wall and aim towards one of them. After a few seconds he will send a shockwave and destroy part of the wall at which he was aimed at. At this point he can do all of his normal patterns.  
After 2 patterns he will initiate 2nd wall break. This one has 2 variations.</p></i>

<p align=justify>2.1 Second wall break - real.</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>Kazeros will jump middle, spawn lines around and also do a front kick with an after-hit towards the side he was aiming during the first wall break. After that he will target one player and send a shockwave again.  
Remember to aim it towards the opposite side of the destroyed part.</p></i>

<p align=justify>2.2 Second wall break - fake.</p>

<video width="800" height="500" controls="" muted="">
    <source src="https://github.com/Rubberoni/Kazeros-G2-Clips/raw/refs/heads/main/G2-1%20Clips/G2-1_900x_Third_Wall_Break_Fake.mp4">
</video>

<i><p align=center>Same as the above except for the shockwave part. Instead of sending a shockwave he will slam the arena covering whole middle zone except for the edges.  
After that he will slam the ground again, this time a small explosion right around him followed by puddles under the players.  
If you get hit by any of the 3 things you will get stunned. You can spacebar through it/GT/cleanse/splendid sacred if you want to greed for damage.</p></i>

<i><p align=center>Way to differentiate between those 2 is to:  
Look at his hand - black glow = real | white glow = fake  
Look at the shockwave indicator - on the fake one it dissapears almost instantly.
Look at his model - there will be a swirl around him if its a real.  
Just choose one of those 3 and you are good to go.</p></i>

<i><p align=center>In both cases its better to preemptively start moving towards the other side and then recognize which one is it.  
He will do both of those. Which means if he didn the real one first he WILL do a fake one after and vice versa.</p></i>

<p align=justify>3. Third wall break.</p>

<i><p align=center>The fake or the real, depending on which one he did first. He will do this one after 3 normal patterns.</p></i>

<p align=justify>4. Flames.</p>

<p align=justify>Now the reason why we have to be precise with the wall breaking - flames. The shockwave cone is also and indicator from which side the 'flames' will spawn.  
They will travel from one side to another and if they collide with any part of the wall they make it explode dealing a heavy raid wide damage or even resulting in a wipe.</p>

<p align=justify>Below is the proper execution of the mech.</p>

<p align=justify>After that the remaining parts of the wall explode and flames come from all sides towards the Kazeros followed by outside-inside safe.</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>If you get hit by a flame you will get a debuff that makes you explode after a few seconds. You can cleanse it or GT it which means you can safely greed on it as long as you have some or of protection from the explosion.</p></i>

## <ins>Blackhole </ins>

<p align=justify>This mech happens after 2-3 patterns after the end of the 'Imprison' mech.</p>

<p align=justify>Kazeros spawns a blackhole in the middle of the arena that pulls players in making movement difficult. During that he targets one person for the whole duration of the mech. He will dash towards that players 2 times. 1st time he will spawn lines on top of himself that imprison players. On the 2nd time he will attempt to grab the player. After that he requires a stagger, during which there are countless explosions + lines around the map. At the end large pizza cones will spawn from the blackhole toward the edges.</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>Targeted player wants to bait the boss outside so that the final cones wont reach you. You want to make sure to todge a grab as well by sidesteping after the 2nd dash.</p></i>

<p align=justify>After the stagger Kazeros will dash middle and begin a stagger check while also slamming the ground and spawning lines around.</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>If you fail the stagger you will have to do it again and his explosion radius will be larger. Otherwise it will look like below.</p></i>
