# <ins>Special patterns</ins>

<p align=justify>These patterns are tied to Kazeros <code style="color : Purple">gauge</code>.</p>

<p align=justify>Just like in Thaemine they happen every time his meter fills up by 25%.</p>

<p align=justify>When the meter reaches 100% just like in Thaemine he does every single <code style="color : Purple">Special pattern</code> that he has done during the fight. Ex.:</p>

<p align=center><code style="color : Purple">Special Co-op counter</code> at 25%</br>
<code style="color : Purple">Chains</code> at 50%</br>
<code style="color : Purple">X</ins></code> at 75%</br>
That means the order of <code style="color : Purple">Special patterns</code> he will do is:</br>  
<code style="color : Purple">Special co-op counter</code> -> <code style="color : Purple">Chains</code> -> <code style="color : Purple">X</code></p>

<p align=justify>All of these patterns have instakill gimmick which means you cant tank them at all (looking at you breakers/gunlancers.  
You can use Crisis evasion to survive them.</p>

## <ins><code style="color : Purple">Chains</ins></code>

<p align=justify>Kazeros spawns black orb which chains with every player. It will try to slow you down and drag you towards itself. After a few seconds Kazeros slashes the orb killing every single player who fails <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> (you have to do it towards Kazeros).</p>

<i><p align=center>There is a way to cheese this pattern. As long as you are behind Kazeros during it you wont have to <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> to survive. The hitbox is only 180 in front of him. The trick is to get behind him using your para/push immune skills so the orb wont drag you towards it.</i></p>

<p align=center>Orb itself only drags you in 1 time so as long as you time your skill correctly you won't get pulled 
in.</p>

<p align=center>If you fail however it can pull you straight from behind Kazeros just like in the video above.  
Timing for para immunity is ~1 second after orb spawns. If you prefer visual clue Kazeros is doing 2 motions:</p>

* &emsp;<i>Holds hand in front which spawns the orb
* &emsp;Spins with his spear</i>

<i><p align=center>That second motion is the timing for para skill. It needs to be done right at the start of it otherwise it's gonna be too late.</p></i>

<i><p align=center>If you get caught you can either timestop or try to <code style="color : Darkorange">guard</code> it. The timing for it is when you see blink on his sword (extremely tight).</p></i>

## <ins><code style="color : Purple">X</ins></code>

<p align=justify>Kazeros dashes towards one player. After dashing he rotates towards him, does a frontal cleave and follows up with X’s shape pattern which instakills any players hit by it.</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>X shape is always coming out of his front so you can use that as an indicator.  
This dash also blackens your screen, but its not always the case. Its inconsistent.</p></i>

## <ins><code style="color : Purple">Special Co-op</ins></code>

<p align=justify>The screen goes black and Kazeros enhances his spear. He does a small dash backwards and <code style="color : Red">aggroes</code> one person. After dashing he will require a <code style="color : Fuchsia">co-op counter</code>. A moment later he will send blue flame in a line shape towards an aggroed person which instakills.</p>

</video>

<i><p align=center>If you fail the <code style="color : Fuchsia">co-op counter</code> he will send 4 blue flames in a line shape that instakill anyone standing on top of them.</p></i>

<i><p align=center>The lingering flame after a successful counter doesn't instakill. Only the initial hit does it.</p></i>

## <ins><code style="color : Purple">Spacebar</ins></code>

<p align=justify>This pattern only happens in P3 and always at 50% <code style="color : Purple">gauge</code>. Kazeros will activate QTE which requires you to spam spacebar and get away from the explosion radius. If you do not make it in time you will just die.</p>
