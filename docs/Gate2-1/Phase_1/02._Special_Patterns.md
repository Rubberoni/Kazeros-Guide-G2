# <ins>Post 900x Patterns</ins>

<p align=justify>This section explains additional patterns that he stars using below 900x.</p>

## <ins>Orbs</ins>
<p align=justify>This pattern happens always the moment party reaches 900x.</p>

<p align=justify>He spawns 5 orbs which target players and follow them. If they touch them they will lift them up and make them unable to take any actions. After a moment Kazeros will dash towards one of the lifted players and do a <code style="color : Blue">counter</code>. After it the spears will drop on 4 players dealing moderate amounts of damage.</p>

<i><p align=center>Make sure to spread after executing <code style="color : Blue">counter</code> to avoid overlapping damage from spears  
Remember to shield/DR lifted people as well, because they cant do anything during this mech.</i></p>

<i><p align=center>If nobody gets hit by the orb mech ends only with 4 spears dropping on players.</i></p>

## <ins>Pillars</ins>
<p align=justify>There are 2 variations of this pattern.</p>

<p align=justify>1. Kazeros spawns pillars around the map that will stay there for a fixed duration. If anyone touches them they will be lifted and unable to do any actions for a few seconds. After that the pillar will explode, dealing damage to them while also making them vulnerable to any attacks that Kazeros might be doing during that. If you don't touch them they will explode by themself.</p>

<p align=justify>2. Kazeros spawns homing orbs that chase players. They <code style="color : Red">aggro</code> to the closest ones to them. The moment they touch them they will spawn pillars in that spot which works exactly the same as in 1st variation.</p>

## <ins>Shield Debuff</ins>

<p align=justify>These 2 patterns introduce stacking buff that the boss gets whenever players get hit by orb from 900x or by touching pillars. It can stack up to 4 and for each one boss deals increased damage to shields.</p>

<p align=justify>When the boss reaches 4 stacks he can do exclusive pattern that has 2 variations.</p>

### 1. <ins>Donut</ins>

<p align=justify>Kazeros throws a spear into the air and spawns expanding explosions. There will be 2 in total: 1 smaller and 1 larger. The small one will be a safe spot after it explodes.</p>

### 2. <ins>Star</ins> 

<p align=justify>Kazeros throws a spear into the air and spawns cracks in the shape of a star. After a moment they explode with safe spots being between the cracks, far from the middle where cracks merge.</p>

<i><p align=center>Both of those patterns will spawn on top of 1 player.  
There is one more gimmick to this pattern and its AOE explosion that happens around 2-3 players which is indicated by swords above their heads.</i></p>

<i><p align=center>After resolving donut/star explosions they need to move away from others to safely explode (check donut pattern).</i></p>
